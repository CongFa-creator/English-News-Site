<li><a href="#block-19">00:09:30 Lost to a really good team.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:09:44 It's a team sport.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:10:01 Those were Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid, defensema</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:10:20 Love to hear from you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:10:45 Welcome.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:10:59 We're having some trouble.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:11:10 I've had a lot of commisserating going on today.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:11:23 I was just covering the games.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:11:39 I'm I'm on about three different text chains with Oiler fans</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:11:52 So, it's interesting to hear.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:12:08 Absolutely tough.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:12:20 We love the Oilers.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:12:31 You know, because you don't get to the play to the finals ve</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:12:48 Mark, they sounded despondent.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:13:06 And then when they got to the final last year and they lost </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:13:19 H, this could happen.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:13:36 And I think there's almost a lot more um people are disconul</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:13:49 Yeah. Um so worse in the last game anyway.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:14:01 The Oilers made it farther than anyone.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:14:20 It really did feel that way to me.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:14:39 Um you look at the Edmonton Oilers and you know the two best</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:14:59 To be honest, I I don't think that they wanted another Canad</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:15:16 So that's an entire generation of fan bases.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:15:27 Sure.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:15:42 Oh no, absolutely.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:15:55 But when it comes to hockey, I think that it it it is very m</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:16:07 Yeah, sure.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:16:25 So, uh, let us know how you feel about that if you're a Canu</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:16:38 1 800 825-559506046693733.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:16:57 And in Edmonton, Mark Connelly, host of CBC's Edmonton AM mo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:17:19 I'm a huge hockey fan.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:17:34 Um, yeah, your thoughts on on the toughness uh of the Oilers</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:17:50 the the ability to dig in and hold the other team accountabl</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:18:04 Goalending.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:18:19 Now, he's had some really good games and he's a hometown guy</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:18:32 Um, but I really think that Florida, as I said, was better i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:18:45 So things can go on this edge.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:19:07 Um, I watched that double overtime game and the stress level</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:19:23 I I think that when you look at We'll start with the goalie.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:19:35 I think there were some errors defensively that were made th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:19:54 And obviously, you mentioned the role players.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:20:05 Sergey Barski, absolutely.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:20:26 want to ask you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:20:39 Then they roared back with Calvin Picker their backup winnin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:20:53 Then they come up against Florida and there's a couple of co</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:21:06 Whether they lost by six goals or one goal or in overtime or</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:21:17 They're exactly what you expect every time."</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:21:29 Your thoughts on the drought, the Stanley Cup drought contin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:21:48 There's so many unknowns that happen for sure.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:22:09 And lastly, you know, I'd like to call it the Gary Bman curs</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:22:26 And, you know, I I would really love to see a Canadian team </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:22:40 I not entirely sure Gary Bman was on the ice for the Oilers </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:23:01 Every other Canadian team has been to the cup final.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:23:11 The Calgary Flames, every Ottawa Centers, they've all done i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:23:24 There are seven Canadian teams.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:23:43 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:23:52 Absolutely.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:24:01 I was um the thing is is that I moved from Montreal, Quebec </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:24:28 And when I came to Pal River, um, I switched to the Vancouve</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:24:58 Uh it to me it didn't matter which team it was.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:25:16 How does that feel, Mark?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:25:32 He's Canadian.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:25:44 There's no way they're going to cheer for the and Calgary fa</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:26:03 Well, Calgaryians are very petty.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:26:19 So, the Oilers would beat them every year.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:26:32 My kids were were younger here.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:26:49 Oh no.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:27:10 So, as the Vancouver fans, there's a lot Yeah. there.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:27:25 Well, let's talk about um I'm going to read an email and the</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:27:44 Uh all Stanley Cup winners have had a goalie ranked top five</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:27:58 I'll ask you both.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:28:13 His extension would kick in the year after that, and he'll l</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:28:27 The Oilers need to attract obviously other players.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:28:44 Yeah. Airfan, your thoughts on uh keeping a talent like McDa</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:28:57 Um he's he's definitely earned it with all his accolades and</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:29:11 And in three years from now, how many or four years from now</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:29:24 Thank you so much.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:29:30 It's always good to talk to Canucks fans.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:29:51 Speaking to the press after the game, he indicated his hopes</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:30:10 It's just because we were maybe the underdogs going to the L</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:30:27 Well, yeah, it feels farther away.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:30:56 All right.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:31:14 Uh Scott writes from Burnaby.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:31:31 Yes, we have a lot of sports to enjoy right now, don't we?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:32:04 And coming up, we're actually going to be live on Tik Tok as</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-104">00:32:20 We're going to have that conversation coming up after the CB</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-105">00:32:46 The district is encouraging people to remain prepared to lea</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:33:05 And the BC Highway Patrol says a 22-year-old man is dead aft</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:33:23 And now the forecast on the north coast, mainly cloudy this </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:33:36 Highs getting close to 30 with a mix of sun and cloud in the</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:33:52 A chance of thunderstorms as well with highs around 19.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:34:10 They won handily.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:34:28 So, there you go.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-112">00:34:41 Anyway, sure.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:34:55 Hello Michelle Elliot, it's Jason D'Souza here.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:35:15 Just a little taste of the BC lieutenant governor's three th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:35:32 Yep.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:35:49 Thanks for that reminder, Steve.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:36:15 Unsold units are sitting empty and there is a shift in BC's </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:36:36 We're asking you, are you in limbo right now with a condo yo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-119">00:37:07 Brian Yu is assistant vice president and chief economist at </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-120">00:37:20 Uh we had this discussion with you about a month ago, Hassan</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-121">00:37:36 We're we're down, you know, on the condo side specifically a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-122">00:37:55 Um you know prices not not necessarily as aggressively comin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-123">00:38:12 That's right. And Brian for yourself looking at the broader </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-124">00:38:37 I think that that's pretty um impactful when it comes to a m</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-125">00:39:27 So when it comes to the interest rate in Canada, it's been h</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-126">00:39:44 they are they're balancing the the risks around uh inflation</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-127">00:40:03 We have them going down to about two and a quarter now in te</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-128">00:40:16 So, um, for a lot of buyers, yes, we probably will see some,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-129">00:40:34 Um, and if you are someone who bought a uh pre-construction </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-130">00:40:56 And what do you think is needed in BC to to get things movin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-131">00:41:15 My guests are the chief economist at Central One Credit Unio</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-132">00:41:32 Yeah, that's a really good point. Um, here we are, uh, Huste</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:42:00 Uh we had high levels of immigration. So we had a lot of peo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-134">00:42:19 Yeah. moving towards the valley trying to get some additiona</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-135">00:42:38 And so sometimes the smaller condos, it may work because the</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-136">00:42:51 Yeah, for for developers when we look at the number of condo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-137">00:43:12 And over time though I think you know I think a lot of us le</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-138">00:43:36 um it's looking for yards and maybe just more common spaces,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-139">00:43:58 And developers seem to be trying to uh adapt or adjust. I kn</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-140">00:44:32 they're going to have to take the risk from the purchaser to</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-141">00:44:50 So, it makes sense. I I like to see it. I think this market </a></li>

<li><a href="#block-143">00:45:28 Thanks so much for watching us on TikTok. Darren is on the l</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-144">00:45:50 But uh for pe for me and probably many like me um it comes d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-145">00:46:19 And it it's just demoralizing to see that, wow, four years a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-146">00:46:43 Yeah. You're in Colona where where demand certainly uh rose </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-147">00:47:02 I think you've touched on what so many um wouldbe buyers hav</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-148">00:47:21 I'm just, um, have an idea that nobody's really talking, but</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-149">00:47:45 And um for a lot of friends that I know like they've had con</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-150">00:48:12 No, long-term rent's not an option because it's a wreck prop</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-151">00:48:43 Uh yeah, how much of an impact has that made on on people wh</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-152">00:49:04 There's uh several on on the Victoria side. And so I these o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-153">00:49:24 We have seen rental rates now come down. I wouldn't attribut</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-154">00:49:43 But it's been a factor for sure.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-155">00:49:55 Because the goal is to create more long-term rent to address</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-156">00:50:10 There is absolutely investment component.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-157">00:50:24 Um but ultimately it helps to drive that actual construction</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-158">00:50:48 So, we ultimately have this kind of a shock in certain marke</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-159">00:51:08 Okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-160">00:51:29 Uh, so we're asking you, are you in limbo right now with a c</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-166">00:52:59 Okay, thank you so much for joining our conversation on this</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-167">00:53:19 In the long term, however, prices are set by what buyers can</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-168">00:53:38 Okay, Sandy, thank you very much.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-169">00:53:53 Prices were going to go up.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-170">00:54:07 I would say like the resale buyer, so let's say a first-time</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-171">00:54:24 I think that's what they're more worried for because they th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-172">00:54:38 There's going to be more supply, prices will be lower.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-173">00:54:51 Um, what advice do you give people right now?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-174">00:55:31 Are you going to rent it for a certain period of time?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-175">00:55:45 You know, I can't believe how much people are are willing to</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-176">00:55:58 You're doing great.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-177">00:56:14 More supply."</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-178">00:56:31 Uh, the government had better not change the regulations.</a></li>

<p>[Music] Hey everyone, it's Wednesday.</p>
<p>[音乐] 大家好，今天是周三。</p>
<p>I'm Ben Rach here in the CBC Vancouver newsroom.</p>
<p>我是本·拉赫，在CBC温哥华新闻室为您播报。</p>
<p>Here's what's happening this afternoon.</p>
<p>以下是今天下午的新闻要点。</p>
<p>Well, BC's premier is calling on Ottawa to declare India's Lawrence Bishnoy gang a terrorist group.</p>
<p>BC省省长呼吁渥太华将印度的Lawrence Bishnoy团伙列为恐怖组织。</p>

<p>He says this gang has been linked to extortions and other crimes against South Asian community members in BC.</p>
<p>他表示该团伙与针对BC省南亚社区成员的勒索和其他犯罪有关。</p>
<p>Eie hopes this will give police more resources to use better tools to investigate.</p>
<p>他希望这将为警方提供更多资源和更好的调查工具。</p>
<p>But BC's former public safety minister says a designation change only goes so far.</p>
<p>但BC省前公共安全部长表示，这种定性改变作用有限。</p>

<p>Well, from a federal level, it may have some application to what has been done.</p>
<p>从联邦层面来看，这可能对已采取的行动有一定影响。</p>
<p>At the ground level, it has very little application that has been done.</p>
<p>但在实际操作层面，它的影响微乎其微。</p>
<p>For example, when we classified Mexican uh organizations as terrorist group when in fact it's made no difference at the ground level in dealing with the drug crisis that we're going through and the availability of drug supply here in Canada.</p>
<p>例如，当我们把墨西哥组织列为恐怖组织时，实际上对解决我们正在经历的毒品危机和加拿大毒品供应问题毫无帮助。</p>

<p>Again, identifying, labeling these groups don't necessarily make a difference.</p>
<p>再次强调，识别和标记这些团体并不一定会带来改变。</p>
<p>Number two is that Lawrence Bishnoy is a thug.</p>
<p>第二点是，Lawrence Bishnoy是个恶棍。</p>
<p>Okay, let's face it.</p>
<p>好吧，面对现实吧。</p>
<p>We got lots of thugs here in British Columbia.</p>
<p>BC省有很多恶棍。</p>
<p>We should be going after these thugs, listing them as a terrorist group when they're not the only, whether it's a local copycat group that's being involved in it or it's an organized international gang that's involved in these types of extortions.</p>
<p>我们应该追查这些恶棍，而不是仅仅将他们列为恐怖组织，无论是本地模仿团体还是有组织的国际团伙参与这类勒索。</p>

<p>未售出单元空置，BC住房市场正在转变。</p>
<p>This week, the BC Real Estate Association put out its latest update, and it says overall home sales in May were 26% below the 10-year average for that month.</p>
<p>BC房地产协会最新数据显示，5月房屋销售比十年平均水平低26%。</p>
<p>You think that brings conditions more toward a buyer's market, but still first-time home buyers don't seem to be coming forward.</p>

<p>Uh we had this discussion with you about a month ago, Hassan, looking at the slowdown in the condo market.</p>
<p>Hassan，我们一个月前讨论过公寓市场放缓。</p>
<p>Um so what do these May numbers from the BC Real Estate Association say to you?</p>
<p>BC房地产协会的五月数据说明了什么？</p>
<p>Yeah, so uh in terms of sales quantity when we're looking at condos uh significantly down.</p>
<p>公寓的销售量显著下降。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-121"></a></p>

<p>We're we're down, you know, on the condo side specifically anywhere from 18 to 20%.</p>
<p>公寓销量下降了18%到20%。</p>
<p>Uh if we look at it over the last couple of years, uh down almost 40% sales quantity-wise.</p>
<p>过去几年销量下降了近40%。</p>
<p>So uh it's no secret the condo market is struggling both on the resale side and the pre-sale side.</p>
<p>公寓市场在转售和预售方面都很艰难。</p>

<p>Um you know prices not not necessarily as aggressively coming down just yet, but that does tend to follow uh prices down a few percentage points.</p>
<p>价格尚未大幅下跌，但可能会下降几个百分点。</p>
<p>So just a a lot of supply in the market um and that's kind of driving you know lower sales activity and the lag in prices uh following suit.</p>
<p>市场供应过剩导致销售活动减少，价格滞后下跌。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>That's right. And Brian for yourself looking at the broader sort of BC economy what does uh what do the the real estate numbers and the drop in sales mean for the economy as a whole?</p>
<p>Brian，从BC省整体经济看，房地产数据下滑意味着什么？</p>
<p>Yeah I think a lot of this actually just partly a reflection of the economy.</p>
<p>这反映了经济状况。</p>
<p>I think there's a lot of uncertainty around uh what we've seen over the past few months with the Trump administration and the impact on uh the economy risk of job loss.</p>
<p>特朗普政府的政策和经济不确定性影响了就业风险。</p>

<p>I think that that's pretty um impactful when it comes to a market like Vancouver where it is so such a high priced market um and affordability is very challenging for most uh potential buyers.</p>
<p>这对温哥华等高房价市场的潜在买家影响很大。</p>
<p>So when we looked at where we were even in the I think the back part of 2024 we had seen some momentum lower interest rates were helping to drive some of that sales flow but really I think a lot of that has just dropped out this year and a lot of those buyers even if they can potentially make those purchases are sitting on the sidelines until uh things are a bit more certain because of the tariffs uh and uh the US tariffs and and Donald Trump's um um implementing uh tariffs and so you know it's interesting because anecdotally I've had I've heard from people who say I just don't know what's going to happen with the economy so I'm going to hold off even though they may have been looking already.</p>
<p>2024年底低利率曾推动销售，但今年买家因关税和经济不确定性持观望态度。</p>

<p>So when it comes to the interest rate in Canada, it's been held um that that was the latest decision from the Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>加拿大央行维持利率不变。</p>
<p>Do you think that there's um an argument to be made to continue to lower the interest rate in the face of a slowing uh real estate market?</p>
<p>面对房地产市场放缓，是否应继续降息？</p>
<p>Yes. So the Bank of Canada is going is kind of in a really challenging position.</p>
<p>央行面临挑战。</p>

<p>they are they're balancing the the risks around uh inflation uh which we know it's still trending around 3% on a core basis.</p>
<p>核心通胀率仍为3%。</p>
<p>Um also uh recognizing that the economy will likely slow although it's been pretty resilient thus far at least in terms of the numbers.</p>
<p>经济可能放缓，但迄今表现坚韧。</p>
<p>Uh our our view is that they will uh ultimately cut.</p>

<p>We have them going down to about two and a quarter now in terms of the their policy rate.</p>
<p>政策利率可能降至2.25%。</p>
<p>That should put a little bit of downward pressure at least on the on on those um mortgage rates.</p>
<p>这将略微压低房贷利率。</p>
<p>But even then, uh, bond yields have remain remaining pretty elevated and that's kind of keeping it up.</p>

<p>So, um, for a lot of buyers, yes, we probably will see some, um, easing in terms of those rates, but it may not be a huge incentive for them to buy at this point.</p>
<p>利率可能小幅下降，但不足以刺激购买。</p>
<p>Okay. We're asking our audience as well, you know, if you are someone who's been looking to buy, have you found that there's not much of an incentive right now for you?</p>

<p>Uh we had high levels of immigration. So we had a lot of people that that could that would actually utilize these as a home for themselves as individuals.</p>
<p>高移民率使小户型适合单身人士。</p>
<p>But that's a great comment because um for families or for people that have dogs or they need the yard, we saw a lot of this during a pandemic where people were moving out of areas like downtown.</p>
<p>但疫情期间，有家庭或宠物的人搬离市中心。</p>

<p>Yeah. moving towards the valley trying to get some additional space and get some room.</p>
<p>转向郊区寻求更大空间。</p>
<p>So, um you know that that thought process has been around a while.</p>
<p>这种需求长期存在。</p>
<p>Um but different strokes for different folks. I will say that there are a lot of buyers that just want to be in a specific location with everything they need around them amenities wise.</p>
<p>但部分买家仍偏好便利地段的小户型。</p>

<p>And so sometimes the smaller condos, it may work because they're spending less time in the condo, uh more time, you know, out and about in the community right in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>小户型适合少居家的社区活跃人群。</p>
<p>Mhm. Um, what do you think this means for choices that developers need to be making, Brian?</p>
<p>Brian，开发商应如何调整策略？</p>

<p>Yeah, for for developers when we look at the number of condos that are kind of sitting empty right now first there there's a lot of them over over 200 units in the lower mainland.</p>
<p>低陆平原现有多达200套空置公寓。</p>
<p>Um, probably a lot of those are those those smaller units and reality was when they were developed when they were planned that fit the market as well whether it was for the investment cycle but also for young buyers as well.</p>
<p>小户型曾适合投资和年轻买家。</p>

<p>And over time though I think you know I think a lot of us learn is that sometimes you need more space and what's happening is that um that that challenge is means that a lot of people may not be looking for these types of units at this point given the immigration cycle given the um given just the normal demographic moves of individuals as they build out families.</p>
<p>但随家庭结构变化，需求转向更大空间。</p>
<p>So for developers it's it is a question of trying to find ways to make things affordable.</p>
<p>开发商需提升 affordability。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>um it's looking for yards and maybe just more common spaces, but again having units that kind of meet today's market, but also potential for future market.</p>
<p>需兼顾当前和未来市场需求。</p>
<p>And that could mean um a lot of things around flexible use of space.</p>
<p>例如灵活空间设计。</p>
<p>And kind of talked a little bit before about um you know, how can we make the existing space we have more flexible of of walls or or size? Can we create layouts that are more amendable?</p>
<p>如可调整的墙体或布局。</p>

<p>And developers seem to be trying to uh adapt or adjust. I know there's one um developer that has a high-rise in Sururi where uh they're actually allowing um uh letting buyers, you know, come back if they change their mind, come back and re and sell it the the unit back to the developers at the original price.</p>
<p>素里有开发商允许买家原价退房。</p>
<p>What do you make of that? I I think it's uh it's an example of the developer realizing the risk that pre-sale buyers take in this market, understanding that if they want to sell these units, uh they're going to have to take some of the risk.</p>
<p>这显示开发商愿分担预售风险。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>they're going to have to take the risk from the purchaser to to get them involved.</p>
<p>需承担部分买方风险以促成交易。</p>
<p>So, I think it's creative. We're seeing a lot more creative type options out there.</p>
<p>此类创新方案增多。</p>
<p>Uh we're starting to see one day sales on condos from developers.</p>
<p>开发商推出“一日促销”。</p>
<p>Um you know, rent rental options as well for when it completes. We can guarantee some rent for you.</p>

<p>So, it makes sense. I I like to see it. I think this market needs creativity.</p>
<p>市场需要创新。</p>
<p>I think risk needs to be shared between uh both the buyer and the developer as well.</p>
<p>买卖双方应共担风险。</p>

<p>Thanks so much for watching us on TikTok. Darren is on the line in Colona. Hi Darren. Thanks for calling in.</p>
<p>感谢TikTok观众。科罗纳听众Darren来电。</p>
<p>Hello there. Thank you. Yeah. Have you been thinking about getting into the market?</p>
<p>你好，有购房计划吗？</p>
<p>I have been. I've been looking for the last two to three years and uh like I get online and I look each evening and just kind of keep an eye on how things are are progressing.</p>

<p>But uh for pe for me and probably many like me um it comes down to just two things.</p>
<p>关键两点：</p>
<p>And one is the fixed mortgage rate specifically. um until it drops below 4%. Um it just eats up far too much of our monthly income.</p>
<p>一是固定利率需低于4%，否则月供压力过大。</p>
<p>Um and then the other is just simply the top price. I mean since the pandemic I mean we have seen gains of two to 300,000 across almost any house or any condo.</p>
<p>二是房价，疫情后普遍上涨20-30万加元。</p>

<p>And it it's just demoralizing to see that, wow, four years ago I could have maybe got into this at 250 and now I'm looking at 500 grand for a one to twobedroom type of a type of a C.</p>
<p>四年前25万加元的一两居室现价50万，令人沮丧。</p>
<p>And these are used. These aren't brand new, right? And you know, you know, you're going to get into having to drop at least 50 maybe thousand to upgrade flooring and paint and the whole thing.</p>
<p>二手房还需额外5万加元装修。</p>

<p>Yeah. You're in Colona where where demand certainly uh rose uh amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>科罗纳疫情期间需求上升。</p>
<p>It it's true for sure. And so I mean we talk about creativity and different options, but it just comes down to our monthly price is killing us and the overall the overall price is just far too high.</p>
<p>月供和总价仍过高。</p>

<p>I'm just, um, have an idea that nobody's really talking, but I haven't heard anybody bring it up yet, and it's the, um, short-term rental thing going on in BC right now.</p>

<p>And um for a lot of friends that I know like they've had condos that they are going to go into the city and use Airbnb it while they're not in town.</p>
<p>许多朋友的度假公寓无法短租。</p>
<p>Um, and they've had to sell those condos now because yeah, they can't like they can't afford it as just to have a wreck property sitting there, right, without some additional income coming in and long-term rent is not an option.</p>

<p>No, long-term rent's not an option because it's a wreck property. Like they might say they live on the Sunshine Coast and they want to go into Vancouver and go for a hockey game and, you know, rent their place out occasionally here and there, make a little bit of extra money.</p>
<p>长期出租不适合度假房产。</p>
<p>Yeah. Tons of people have been doing that in BC and it's Yes, absolutely. I mean that that was it it certainly was an issue for the provincial government and so they have uh implemented these rules um restricting Airbnb or short-term rentals um to your primary residence on your property.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think Sheena brings up a really good point because there are properties across the province that have been designed for short-term rentals, recreational properties, uh smaller condos, stratified hotel type units.</p>

<p>Uh people don't want to long-term rent these properties.</p>
<p>这些房产不适合长租。</p>

<p>We have seen rental rates now come down. I wouldn't attribute it specifically to that.</p>
<p>租金下降不全是因此。</p>
<p>Uh, but it, you know, plays a part. Everything plays a part.</p>

<p>Uh, and I think the province now uh, has said that, you know, over time they may look to uh, revise some of this legislation if that rental market continues to stabilize.</p>

<p>Because the goal is to create more long-term rent to address the rental crisis in BC.</p>
<p>因为目标是增加长期租赁房源，以解决BC省的租赁危机。</p>
<p>Yeah, I I think there's a couple of challenges from the from the legislation in in itself.</p>
<p>是的，我认为法规本身存在一些挑战。</p>
<p>A lot of the demand that kind of comes in to drive new construction as well is investment.</p>
<p>推动新建设的很大一部分需求也来自投资。</p>

<p>There is absolutely investment component.</p>
<p>投资成分绝对存在。</p>
<p>It's an important part of the overall market.</p>
<p>它是整个市场的重要组成部分。</p>
<p>It helps developers um get to the stage that they can actually build new product um with the anticipation that some of those units will be investments.</p>
<p>它帮助开发商进入实际建设新产品的阶段，并预期其中部分单元将成为投资品。</p>

<p>Um but ultimately it helps to drive that actual construction.</p>
<p>但最终它有助于推动实际建设。</p>
<p>So, you know, without some of that investment cycle, we don't get to build to house people um who want long-term housing and home ownership housing as well.</p>
<p>因此，没有这种投资循环，我们就无法为需要长期住房和自有住房的人建设。</p>
<p>Um, one other component around the around the short-term rentals, especially in some of the um, markets across the province, is that it takes away or at least it's um, takes away potential housing for tourists as well.</p>
<p>另一个关于短期租赁的方面，尤其是在全省部分市场中，是它减少或至少削弱了游客的潜在住房供应。</p>

<p>So, we ultimately have this kind of a shock in certain markets, say in the interior, in the Okonogan, where there just not enough um, hotel rooms available or or increases the pricing for hotels as well.</p>
<p>因此，我们最终在某些市场（比如内陆、奥肯那根）面临这种冲击，那里酒店房间不足或价格上涨。</p>
<p>So again, there are some of these additional shocks that are outside the housing market that we do have to look at when we think about legislation around demand.</p>

<p>I would say like the resale buyer, so let's say a first-time home buyer, I think they they are concerned about, you know, where that value will be in the future, but I think they're more concerned that the value doesn't drop off a cliff in the next 6 months, right?</p>
<p>我认为转售买家，比如首次购房者，他们更担心的是未来6个月价值不会暴跌，对吧？</p>

<p>I think that's what they're more worried for because they they are making purchase decisions based on their lifestyle, their family, they're getting married, they're having kids, they have to do this.</p>
<p>我认为这是他们更担心的，因为他们的购买决定基于生活方式、家庭、结婚、生子等需求。</p>

<p>There's going to be more supply, prices will be lower.</p>
<p>供应会增加，价格会更低。</p>
<p>Do we wait six months?"</p>

<p>So, it's it's FOMO, but it's like opposite FOMO where you're not you're not a fear of missing out what's today, you're fear of what's missing out tomorrow, right?</p>

<p>比如如果他们因预售房被困几个月。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>So, so, so on the pre-sale, we have to find a way to close it is number one.</p>
<p>对于预售房，首要任务是找到完成交易的方法。</p>
<p>So sometimes uh if that means you have to get alternative lending which is you know not not amazing right the the rates are going to be higher you have to find a way to close it uh and what I do with my clients is before we even buy I say are you going to be able to complete this cuz I need to be able to sleep at night and if someone comes to me and says I'm buying this I don't really have a means to complete I'll flip it later I'll say see you later um because I can't that's not something that that I want to take on but you have to close on it and then we come up with a plan.</p>
<p>有时这意味着你需要获得替代贷款（利率会更高），但必须完成交易。我与客户合作时，甚至在购买前就会问：“你能完成交易吗？因为我需要安心。”如果有人告诉我：“我买这个但没有完成交易的方法，我之后会转手。”我会说再见，因为我不想承担这种风险。但你必须完成交易，然后我们制定计划。</p>
