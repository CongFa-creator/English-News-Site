<li><a href="#block-38">00:16:12 The health authority says the initial case looks to have bee</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:16:33 We've seen the measles that both in Alberta and in Ontario t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:17:10 I think that uh there are probably kind of two particularly </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:17:38 So those are two things that we are particularly watch out f</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:18:00 Well, we're asking you what are your questions about the mea</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:18:17 You can also hit pound690 on your cell phone or our email is</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:18:34 Uh Katrina, thanks so much for joining us.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:18:48 Yeah, I think I think um very concerned uh across Canada.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:19:05 It's concerning when there's more than one case.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:19:34 Yeah, it's it's surprising and not surprising.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:19:51 When we have the vaccine, we're considered immune.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:20:06 And when the numbers of people in our whole population start</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:20:31 So when we have low vaccination rates and we have a a large </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:20:59 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:21:24 And what do we know about the vaccination rate against measl</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:21:41 Um and the target is 95%.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:22:01 So we have not seen these kinds of outbreaks of measles for </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:22:20 It's not been top of mind because the vaccination has been s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:22:40 Um, what are your questions about it and how concerned are y</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:22:58 And let's take a call from Alderove now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:23:35 So I feel like systemically, you know, there's definitely an</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:23:56 Um I wonder that too.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:24:09 What do we know about how um how we track vaccination among </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:24:29 they do what's called a teeter um and they'll check and see </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:24:58 So we have really a lot of confidence in the effectiveness o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:25:26 Um, and if you're still uncertain and you do want to have th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:25:53 Interesting.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:26:09 Um, but if she's looking for spec kind of specific advice fo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:26:30 Uh so I wouldn't presume to give advice to her particularly,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:26:51 Um, ask your questions cuz I think a lot of times too, peopl</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:27:09 So, there's lots of great resources that might be tailored t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:27:29 Have them prepared before you go.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:27:49 And I I presume you'd recommend go to Health Link BC, find y</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:28:03 Okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:28:25 um what what are your thoughts around that and what role it </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:28:54 So um there were there were many disruptions that have contr</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:29:26 And people have more questions um sometimes than they've had</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:29:54 Even if it was wrong information, it sticks with them.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:30:20 And um sometimes we just might not know the severity of the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:30:45 Let's take one more call here from Denise and Cam Loops.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:31:12 I just wondered why there's so uh much fear-mongering going </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:31:29 So tell us why what makes measles life-threatening and why t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:31:53 So infants and newborns um can die.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:32:14 They can get a serious pneumonia.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:32:33 And there's no cure for measles.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:32:52 And the most vulnerable are the very young, their infants an</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:33:09 Um but for those who it is really serious uh they they lose </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:33:33 In fact, in Ontario, um uh just a couple of weeks ago, they </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:33:52 And so that uh that is exactly the case that uh that you're </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:34:12 So if you can imagine 94 million lives since the 1970s have </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:34:30 And Katrina, always good to speak with you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:34:40 You're with BC Today here on CBC.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:35:00 Uh are you what what are your thoughts when it comes to the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:35:18 Good afternoon.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:35:33 It is about 1,500 square kilometers.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:35:53 There are 95 active wildfires in the province right now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:36:10 Dr. Brian Conway with the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Cent</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:36:27 And now the forecast on the north coast.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:36:42 Highs up to 27 with a mix of sun and cloud in the Coupney.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:36:58 That's your CBC News update from Vancouver.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:37:20 Here's what's coming up on the coast with guest host Jason D</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:37:43 We're going to talk to the Suriri school district and we'll </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:37:56 Plus, SFU President Joy Johnson has been appointed chair of </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:38:11 Tune in from 3 to 6.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:38:29 You can listen as well on the CBC News app.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:39:28 Well, AI is certainly transforming society, but are there en</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-104">00:39:50 We're at bc today at cbc.ca.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-105">00:40:07 Good afternoon.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:40:21 I want to ask you Rosita, can you just give us a sense of ho</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:40:52 It takes our data.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:41:37 Wow.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:41:55 So AI is slightly different because or or a lot different.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:42:12 making sure data is uh you know of high quality making sure </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:42:36 It sounds like that's the hope uh when it comes to the G7 le</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-112">00:43:07 I know our government has said a lot about uh using AI to po</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:43:49 When when it comes to those checks and balances, um well, le</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:44:11 Um what's needed there?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:44:29 Well, let's talk a little bit about uh AI infrastructure as </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:44:55 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:45:25 um with a lot of things like our health and and you know per</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:45:40 So we're asking you what are your own concerns around AI and</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-119">00:46:03 So, if you're someone who finds that AI is impacting your wo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-120">00:46:19 1 800 825-5950604-669-3733.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-121">00:46:40 And Rosita, you mentioned earlier how AI does rely on data, </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-122">00:47:00 Um what's needed to be able to address that to make sure tha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-123">00:47:19 So data uh that we collect could be a number of issues.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-124">00:47:38 Uh I think international organizations are paying a lot of a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-125">00:48:13 Other issues related to data is privacy.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-126">00:48:51 Um so um so these are just some of the challenges.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-127">00:49:09 So imbalanced power you know organizations that have access </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-128">00:49:29 Um so but but again data is fundamental to training AI.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-129">00:49:45 Is any of that being done right now?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-130">00:50:03 I'm not sure how much data privacy is taken is being taken s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-131">00:50:33 Uh just an observation that ever since the invention of the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-132">00:50:52 And then uh robots took over skilled labor and now we're goi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:51:09 Well guess what?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-134">00:51:35 And uh so unless we can find some way of of sharing the weal</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-135">00:51:52 So if you're talking about yeah art and music that is even p</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-136">00:52:16 Um I think that was a a great statement and I mean to to set</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-137">00:54:02 Graham.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-138">00:55:01 Adrienne is our next caller now in the Cowitch and Valley.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-139">00:55:24 you know, I mean, the bills were promoted through parliament</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-140">00:56:15 I've had six major thefts.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-141">00:56:47 You know, it it was all tied up.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-142">00:57:07 Uh, you know, being arbitrarily detained.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-143">00:57:23 You know, the we've heard the word guard rails, right?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-144">00:57:37 Rosita?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-145">00:58:11 So for example, general data protection regulation which was</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-146">00:58:37 Uh I think Canada has been a bit slow in um the I know there</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-147">00:59:03 So the the example that are um that was given uh by the tech</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-148">00:59:24 So it's a matter of speeding up to catch up and it sounds li</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-149">00:59:36 Thank you so much for your time.</a></li>

<p>Hey everyone, it's Tuesday, June 17.</p>
<p>大家好，今天是6月17日星期二。</p>
<p>Thanks for joining us.</p>
<p>感谢大家的参与。</p>
<p>I'm Benique RA here in the CBC Vancouver newsroom.</p>
<p>我是CBC温哥华新闻室的Benique RA。</p>
<p>Let's get to your top headlines this afternoon.</p>
<p>以下是今天下午的头条新闻。</p>
<p>Well, Vancouver City Council has unanimously voted to rename a street in Vancouver's Kitselone neighborhood.</p>
<p>温哥华市议会一致投票决定更名Kitselone社区的一条街道。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-2"></a></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wDN5zVEkG/?t=128" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:02:08</span></a></h3>
<p>It's what members of the Muskream Indian Band call a step forward for reconciliation.</p>
<p>Muskream印第安部落成员称这是和解的一大进步。</p>
<p>So Trud Street will be renamed Muskim Musquium View Street in English and Schwakam awesome in the Musquam Indian Bands language.</p>
<p>Trud街将更名为Muskim Musquium View Street（英文）和Schwakam（Musquam原住民语言）。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wDN5zVEkG/?t=142" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:02:22</span></a></h3>
<p>It comes after unanimous vote uh in July 2021 where the city council voted to replace the name of the street which was originally named after BC's first lieutenant governor Joseph Trut.</p>
<p>此前，市议会于2021年7月一致投票决定更换这条以BC省首任副总督Joseph Trut命名的街道名称。</p>
<p>It's being renamed because of Trut's racist policies against indigenous people.</p>
<p>更名原因是Trut针对原住民的种族主义政策。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-4"></a></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wDN5zVEkG/?t=158" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:02:38</span></a></h3>
<p>Those include drastically reducing the size of reserves and refusing to let indigenous people purchase land from those who are non-indigenous.</p>
<p>这些政策包括大幅缩减保留地面积，并禁止原住民从非原住民手中购买土地。</p>
<p>While this is a street renaming, it means a lot more to indigenous people.</p>
<p>尽管只是一条街道的更名，但对原住民意义重大。</p>

<p>We've seen the measles that both in Alberta and in Ontario that it uh that has it can be the larger uh the kind of cluster and outbreak particularly with a high attack rate for the susceptible populations and uh that we are uh kind of watching closely in our susceptible population in the northern BC uh particularly in the northeast BC that the the immunization rate uh is below what we need for the her immunity that to the leopard that protect all the community.</p>
<p>我们在阿尔伯塔省和安大略省都看到麻疹疫情，它可能形成更大的聚集性暴发，尤其是对易感人群的高感染率，我们正密切关注不列颠哥伦比亚省北部，特别是东北部的易感人群，因为那里的免疫接种率低于我们需要的群体免疫水平，无法保护整个社区。</p>

<p>Yeah, I think I think um very concerned uh across Canada.</p>
<p>我认为在整个加拿大都非常令人担忧。</p>
<p>We're seeing really increasing rates and this has been happening around the world for the last um several years.</p>

<p>It's concerning when there's more than one case.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's it's surprising and not surprising.</p>
<p>这既令人惊讶又不令人惊讶。</p>
<p>I I think we can anticipate that this was possible because um as we heard with the speaker before, we have um really significant shifts in the coverage.</p>
<p>我认为我们可以预见到这是可能的，因为正如之前发言人所说，我们的疫苗接种覆盖率发生了显著变化。</p>
<p>That means the number of people in our population who have the vaccine.</p>

<p>When we have the vaccine, we're considered immune.</p>
<p>当我们接种疫苗后，就被认为是免疫的。</p>
<p>So after we've received our two doses, um then our our bodies can fight the virus whenever we're exposed to it.</p>
<p>因此，在我们接种两剂疫苗后，我们的身体就能在接触病毒时与之对抗。</p>
<p>But if we don't have that immunity, then there's a really high chance of getting sick.</p>

<p>And when the numbers of people in our whole population start getting lower, when we have fewer and fewer people who are vaci vaccinated, then the um benefits to all of us for our collective kind of immunity or what what we'll often hear called herd immunity.</p>
<p>当我们整个人口中接种疫苗的人数开始减少时，我们集体免疫或常说的群体免疫对所有人的益处就会减少。</p>
<p>When that that goes down and that means that all of us are more susceptible to being exposed and the virus can actually move more freely around a population.</p>
<p>当这种情况下降时，意味着我们所有人都更容易暴露在病毒中，病毒实际上可以在人群中更自由地传播。</p>

<p>So when we have low vaccination rates and we have a a large number of cases and we know that this is one of the most contagious uh viruses or and um measles is the most infectious thing that we know about u for human diseases then then the fact that rates are going up is expected given the certain the the conditions that we're in right now this context of lower um vaccination coverage the most infectious.</p>
<p>因此，当我们疫苗接种率低且病例数量多时，我们知道这是最具传染性的病毒之一，麻疹是我们所知的人类疾病中最具传染性的，那么在目前疫苗接种覆盖率较低的背景下，发病率上升是意料之中的。</p>

<p>So, um more than 90% of people who are exposed to it, if we're if we don't have immunity, we will get some symptoms.</p>
<p>因此，如果我们没有免疫力，超过90%接触麻疹的人会出现一些症状。</p>

<p>What do we know about how um how we track vaccination among adults?</p>
<p>关于成人疫苗接种追踪，我们了解多少？</p>
<p>Yeah, I Well, what we do is we rely on um really reliable and robust data from around the world about how effective the vaccine is.</p>
<p>我们依赖全球关于疫苗有效性的可靠数据。</p>
<p>And so, it is true you can get a blood test to see what your immunity is like.</p>
<p>确实可通过验血检测免疫力。</p>

<p>they do what's called a teeter um and they'll check and see you know what's going on in your body as in terms of antibodies and um response to measles.</p>
<p>通过抗体滴度测试检查身体对麻疹的抗体反应。</p>
<p>So we don't routinely check that for all people um because once you've received two doses of the vaccine you are considered immune and that's based on having monitored and um measured how this vaccine works in populations over um many many years now and with many millions of people.</p>
<p>我们不对所有人常规检测，因为接种两剂即视为免疫——这是基于对数百万人多年的疫苗效果监测。</p>

<p>So we have really a lot of confidence in the effectiveness of the vaccine.</p>
<p>因此我们对疫苗效力极具信心。</p>
<p>Um but if people were born um uh after 1970, it's wise to check what your vaccination status is.</p>
<p>但1970年后出生者建议核查接种记录。</p>
<p>And so you can reach out to your local public health uh unit or you can check by going to HealthLink BC and there's some links you can follow to check your own vaccination status, see what your records are and make sure that you've received the two doses.</p>
<p>可联系当地卫生部门或访问HealthLink BC查看接种记录，确保完成两剂接种。</p>

<p>Um, and if you're still uncertain and you do want to have the blood test, then you can have a conversation with your your GP or your nurse practitioner um, whoever your your primary care provider is, and they can talk to you about um, how you can find out what your vaccination status is and whether you need a booster um, or a second dose.</p>
<p>若仍不确定，可咨询家庭医生或护士，讨论是否需要抗体检测/加强针。</p>
<p>If you were born before 1970, generally um, most of the population was exposed and so are also considered immune.</p>
<p>1970年前出生者通常因自然暴露被视为免疫。</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>有意思。</p>
<p>Uh, we actually have an email from Norya who writes, "I'm 72 years old. I'm not absolutely sure if I had measles as a as a child.</p>
<p>听众Norya来信："我72岁，不确定童年是否患过麻疹。</p>
<p>Um, so what is the advice for my age group?"</p>
<p>对我这个年龄组有何建议？"</p>
<p>And you're saying so presumably you would have been exposed to it.</p>
<p>您刚才提到这类人群可能已自然暴露。</p>

<p>Um, but if she's looking for spec kind of specific advice for a 72-year-old, what might that be?</p>
<p>但若她需要针对72岁人群的具体建议？</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>Again, I think a conversation with their um their primary care provider because for each person, you know, there may be underlying conditions or other things going on for them that might make it um might make them that might be particular consideration for them.</p>
<p>建议咨询家庭医生，因为个人健康状况可能需要特殊考量。</p>

<p>Uh so I wouldn't presume to give advice to her particularly, but generally um the way that it's dealt with uh in terms of a public health strategy is that people born before 1970 are considered immune and people born after 1970 um if they've received two doses are considered immune.</p>
<p>公共卫生策略默认1970年前出生者免疫，之后出生者需完成两剂接种。</p>
<p>So, check your vaccination records, have a conversation.</p>
<p>因此请核对接种记录并咨询医生。</p>

<p>Um, ask your questions cuz I think a lot of times too, people get worried about not being heard or not having um their questions answered.</p>
<p>积极提问，因为人们常担心被忽视。</p>
<p>And so, take the time to write your questions down, bring those with you to your appointment, uh, and ask where you can get more information.</p>

<p>So, there's lots of great resources that might be tailored to your specific health circumstances and and it's worth um taking that time to ask and if your own GP or nurse practitioner doesn't have the information, they should be able to direct you to a place or they will go to someone who will.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>
<p>好的。</p>
<p>Um we don't know um really specifics around the 18 cases right now in Wan, but what are your thoughts given the decline in in vaccination?</p>
<p>目前Wan地区18例病例详情未知，但考虑到接种率下降，您有何看法？</p>
<p>Um you know of since the covid pandemic there has been um that that uh you know vaccine skepticism skepticism that was an issue at the time as well.</p>

<p>um what what are your thoughts around that and what role it might be playing as we see uh measles rising?</p>
<p>这对麻疹病例增加有何影响？</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there's two pieces to that.</p>
<p>我认为有两方面因素。</p>
<p>So, one is during the course of the pandemic there was a lot of interruption to routine immunization schedules um around the world uh some children had no access to their um routine immunizations and uh sometimes it was because clinics weren't open or weren't available.</p>
<p>一是疫情期间全球常规免疫计划中断，部分儿童无法接种（因诊所关闭）。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wDN5zVEkG/?t=1734" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:28:54</span></a></h3>
<p>So um there were there were many disruptions that have contributed to this rise in um uh or the the decrease in vaccine coverage for at a population level.</p>
<p>这些干扰导致人群接种率下降。</p>
<p>And then the other piece you bring up is a really good point about vaccine skepticis skepticism and hesitancy.</p>
<p>二是你提到的疫苗怀疑/犹豫问题。</p>
<p>And I think we've never really been in a moment um where there's been so much public dialogue and um sometimes divisive and polarized dialogue about vaccines and what they mean for us and how they work in our bodies.</p>
<p>当前关于疫苗的公共讨论空前激烈且两极分化。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-74"></a></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wDN5zVEkG/?t=1766" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:29:26</span></a></h3>
<p>And people have more questions um sometimes than they've had answers for.</p>
<p>人们的疑问常得不到解答。</p>
<p>And we've also had some scares uh some uh fraudulent information circulating about vaccines which um understandably caused concern for some parents.</p>
<p>虚假疫苗信息也引发家长合理担忧。</p>
<p>And and it might be that they've heard about some of this but haven't had their concerns addressed or responded to or um their worries about it because of the information that they heard.</p>
<p>他们可能听闻错误信息却未获解答。</p>

<p>Even if it was wrong information, it sticks with them.</p>
<p>即便信息错误仍印象深刻。</p>
<p>So they have big questions and they haven't always felt heard.</p>
<p>因此他们怀有强烈疑问却感觉被忽视。</p>
<p>And so I think we have a real responsibility right now as a public health community to listen to what people's worries are um to make sure that information is clear and available and that parents have what they need to make good choices uh for their kids because everyone is trying to do their best to keep their kids well and safe.</p>

<p>we might not know the risks of and so when we're weighing those risks and benefits of whether to take a vaccine or not.</p>
<p>在权衡接种风险收益时缺乏认知。</p>
<p>I think we really need compassionate and um uh clear like safe spaces for good conversation about what what information is available and and how can we make the best choices for our kids and for ourselves.</p>

<p>Hi Denise, go ahead.</p>
<p>你好Denise，请讲。</p>
<p>What's your question?</p>
<p>您有何问题？</p>
<p>You know, I just I wanted to ask um is uh is the measles life-threatening?</p>
<p>我想问：麻疹会致命吗？</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>Yes, it is a very serious when I you know I'm I'm in my 70s and um I uh had measles as a child and uh it was no big deal.</p>

<p>I just wondered why there's so uh much fear-mongering going on around measles.</p>
<p>我不理解为何现在对麻疹如此恐慌。</p>
<p>I don't I really don't understand this.</p>
<p>真的无法理解。</p>
<p>Is it I think maybe it's because you want to push the vaccines.</p>

<p>Is that it?</p>

<p>So tell us why what makes measles life-threatening and why that might be in congruent with her experience having gotten it as a child.</p>
<p>请解释麻疹的致命性为何与她的童年经历不同。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>好的。</p>
<p>So it um it's an So it is life-threatening.</p>
<p>麻疹确实可能致命。</p>
<p>It's not life-threatening for all people who get it.</p>
<p>并非所有患者都会危及生命。</p>
<p>Uh so not everyone who gets measles will have a really severe case but some will and especially young children.</p>
<p>但部分患者（尤其是幼儿）会出现重症。</p>

<p>So infants and newborns um can die.</p>
<p>婴幼儿可能死亡。</p>
<p>Uh and it's it's not so much that someone in her age group is likely to die if they got and maybe they wouldn't even get sick at all.</p>
<p>她所在年龄组即使感染也可能无症状。</p>
<p>They might not have any symptoms if they were exposed.</p>
<p>暴露后可能毫无症状。</p>
<p>But a newborn child or an infant under 12 who hasn't yet had a dose of vaccine can get severely ill.</p>

<p>They can get a serious pneumonia.</p>

<p>导致脑损伤。</p>
<p>Uh they can have it can be lifealtering for those who it is very severe.</p>
<p>重症可能改变人生轨迹。</p>
<p>And as I said before, about one in 10 people will be hospitalized because their symptoms are so severe.</p>

<p>And there's no cure for measles.</p>
<p>麻疹无特效药。</p>
<p>We can treat the symptoms, but we can't cure it once we're sick with it.</p>
<p>只能对症治疗。</p>
<p>We have to let it run its course.</p>
<p>必须等待病程结束。</p>
<p>And so, um, it's not fear-mongering that is is the goal.</p>
<p>我们的目的并非散播恐慌。</p>
<p>The goal is to make sure people understand just how serious it can be for those who are most vulnerable.</p>

<p>And the most vulnerable are the very young, their infants and newborns.</p>
<p>最脆弱的是婴幼儿。</p>
<p>And so, um, if you were an older child and exposed to measles, it might not have been as big of a deal.</p>
<p>因此年长儿童感染可能问题不大。</p>
<p>You might not have been hospitalized.</p>

<p>Well, let's talk a little bit about uh AI infrastructure as a whole.</p>
<p>首先整体谈谈AI基础设施。</p>
<p>I think you know as I'd already said having skilled people uh and Ken has a lot of uh you know great talent uh with specific skills in AI and also a great research ecosystem but I think um to kind of put this in context Canada's um AI infrastructure capacity is uh kind of among the lowest uh among G7 countries.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>Um and our kind of total performance is actually you know half that uh of of the UK's which you know we had just signed a big research collaboration with and I think it it this this gap of of infrastructure poses a serious risk.</p>
<p>我国整体表现仅为英国的一半（刚签署重大研究合作），这种基础设施差距构成重大风险。</p>
<p>It could slow down uh our our research ecosystem hinder our startups and uh leave businesses that are dependent dependent on you know um you know foreign cloud providers which could be potentially problematic.</p>

<p>Well guess what?</p>

<p>Um I think that was a a great statement and I mean to to set the context for that you know majority of Canadians are are quite skeptical of AI and I think uh the skepticism isn't unique to Canada.</p>
<p>我认为这是一个很好的陈述，我想为此设定背景，大多数加拿大人对AI持怀疑态度，而这种怀疑不仅限于加拿大。</p>
<p>I mean across you know the G7 even people worry about issues like privacy bias job displacement displacement and safety and some of our research at the conference board of Canada has investigated this especially you know in the context of of automating you know tasks and workers as a whole and and what we found is you know generally a lot um of the kind of economic tasks that uh AI can do now um won't you know fully replace an occupation our process with the majority of work being um requiring a human in the loop and um I think it's really important that we need to think about how um workers are upskilled um and provided new skills that you know allow them to uh you know work alongside AI and make their jobs maybe a little bit more creative require more kind of critical thinking and less so um focused on tasks that are you know kind of routine and and uh don't require as much kind of uh I guess thought the drudgery I think was what was the the word Phil that used Phil used but at the same time I don't know I'm seeing quite a bit of of um AI generated content that seems um realistic I it's really moved along a lot is that is that um or are we being optimistic by thinking that that's not going to be um uh ultimately a result uh more and more of our own thinking being taken up by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>在G7国家中，人们担心隐私偏见、工作替代和安全等问题。我们在加拿大会议委员会的研究调查了这一点，特别是在自动化任务和工人的背景下。我们发现，AI目前可以完成的许多经济任务不会完全取代职业或流程，大多数工作仍需要人类参与。我认为重要的是思考如何提升工人的技能，提供新技能，使他们能够与AI一起工作，并使他们的工作更具创造性，需要更多批判性思维，而不是专注于那些常规的、不需要太多思考的任务（Phil称之为苦差事）。但与此同时，我看到许多AI生成的内容看起来非常逼真，AI已经取得了很大进展。我们是否过于乐观地认为这不会最终导致越来越多的人类思维被人工智能取代？</p>

<p>Well, I would um well, I wouldn't necessarily say um that um you know, AI is out there to to fully automate or replace, but I think it's it's ability to complement and augment you know, exist existing um kind of workflows like even for an artist to help them ideulate um you know, an image or or a setting h and then have you know them use their expertise and ability to make you know that that that painting or that idea whole is something that's that's that could be quite useful and you know it it might not necessarily uh replace um the the artistic uh creation process as a whole but definitely I think it will um complement many parts of it um and similar to like a a creative writer or or even a journalist right none of my script or none of what I say is AI generated let's just make that earlier.</p>
<p>我不会说AI旨在完全自动化或取代，但它能够补充和增强现有的工作流程。例如，对于艺术家，AI可以帮助他们构思图像或场景，然后他们可以利用自己的专业知识和能力完成绘画或创意。这可能非常有用，它不一定会完全取代艺术创作过程，但肯定会补充其中的许多部分。对于创意作家或记者也是如此，我的脚本或所说的话都不是AI生成的。</p>

<p>最终在1月6日，Richard先生因未披露某些事情而下台，但在这个过程中，没有出台任何措施来保护失去安全的人，我就是其中之一，这对我生活产生了重大负面影响。我几乎两年多没有手机，还遭遇了多次重大盗窃。</p>

<p>我只是去美国度假，我的车就被一些人假装警察用拖车劫持了。</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>天哪。</p>
<p>you know, and I mean, I know it was fake because a couple days later when I did show up um in another town where supposedly my car was impounded at a towing truck company, that police officer, same one, came again with another guy to intimidate me.</p>
<p>我知道那是假的，因为几天后当我出现在另一个城镇，据说我的车被扣押在一家拖车公司时，同一个警察又带着另一个人来恐吓我。</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>So uh you know one of the challenges with these technologies uh is that they are moving so fast and they are becoming so sophisticated quickly that we are having a hard time to catch uh first of all understand actual risks of these technologies because we don't want to limit the use of them or uh limit you know being innovative using these technologies but privacy has been one of the topics that has been you know it is a little bit more established than AI I governance or other aspects.</p>
<p>这些技术的挑战之一是它们发展如此之快，迅速变得非常复杂，以至于我们很难跟上。首先，我们需要理解这些技术的实际风险，因为我们不想限制它们的使用或创新。但隐私是一个比AI治理或其他方面更成熟的议题。</p>

<p>So for example, general data protection regulation which was established in 2018 in in uh in Europe that could be a golden standard that uh you know for us to look at you know principles and best practices that they have established and they have been working on it quite a bit in the past uh six seven years.</p>
<p>例如，2018年在欧洲建立的《通用数据保护条例》可以作为一个黄金标准，我们可以参考他们建立的原则和最佳实践，他们在过去六七年里在这方面做了很多工作。</p>
<p>We can uh you know adopt some of those best practices and and they are well established.</p>
<p>我们可以采用其中一些最佳实践，它们已经非常成熟。</p>

<p>Uh I think Canada has been a bit slow in um the I know there is a there was a new regulation under uh review but uh we can easily uh you know think about which ones would be more suitable for Canada those best practices and adopt them.</p>
<p>我认为加拿大在这方面有些滞后，我知道有一项新法规正在审查中，但我们可以轻松思考哪些最佳实践更适合加拿大并采用它们。</p>
<p>Um but one thing is the the regulation the other part is our technology providers immediately using these best practices and standards that are available.</p>
<p>一方面是法规，另一方面是我们的技术提供商立即使用这些现有的最佳实践和标准。</p>

<p>So the the example that are um that was given uh by the technology it was something related to the car and uh and also all the data uh you know encryption there are many best practices and standards existing technology providers can use and that's quite slow as well.</p>
<p>例如，技术提供商提到的与汽车相关的例子以及数据加密，有许多现有的最佳实践和标准可供技术提供商使用，但进展也很缓慢。</p>

<p>So it's a matter of speeding up to catch up and it sounds like there's a template there um that perhaps the leaders can follow up on.</p>
