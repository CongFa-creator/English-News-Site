<li><a href="#block-38">00:15:08 We do become acclimatized fairly quickly to uh elevated heat</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:15:24 Right.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:15:36 So, looking at ways that we can keep the home environment co</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:15:50 And then taking some of the other measures that we can.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:16:11 And Dr. Sean, what are your thoughts on um first let's let's</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:16:25 Um and so they're saying residents should take seriously and</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:16:58 Absolutely.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:17:12 So in the shorter run, people with asthma or chronic obstruc</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:17:29 So it's not just the our breathing that's impacted and we se</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:17:47 What would be our advice for mitigating the effects of those</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:18:10 As well as that, there's more and more scientific findings t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:18:23 However, not every home is is equipped with the sort of uh w</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:18:43 And then finally, building that more and more into our build</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:18:56 My guest is Dr. Michael Schwant, medical health officer at V</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-54">00:20:06 Yes, Michael.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:20:15 So, this is something you know about from a personal and sor</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-60">00:21:54 are these things.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:22:18 So, for example, to very high heat, to wildfire, smoke and s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:22:38 So when we see measures in place to uh help with funding for</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:22:53 Hi, welcome.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:23:04 Well, as you know uh it's not just increasingly uh hotter ho</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-66">00:24:05 Um and um so I I I'm thinking that what we need uh is the uh</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:24:26 um can go to running uh other uh air conditioning systems on</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:24:51 Yeah, really good to hear from you.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-75">00:27:21 So, we really want to encourage folks to not be afraid of tr</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:27:51 I can see how people would be apprehensive of that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:28:06 Well, Fires Smart BC has been great about looking at the typ</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:28:25 Um, and in general, um, there's a basically 10 meters from y</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-80">00:29:17 And then you have that added long-term benefit beyond those </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:29:34 It's an interesting uh project that you've undertaken.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-87">00:31:37 So, as Christian had mentioned, we really need housing that'</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:31:52 So, looking at the underlying infrastructure of our housing </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:32:05 some more passive measures uh are built right into the desig</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:32:53 Yeah, certainly something uh to keep in mind as we head into</a></li>

<p>This is uh very early summer for a event of the type that we're looking at.</p>

<p>Right.</p>
<p>好的。</p>
<p>So, what are the things we should be keeping in mind then heading into the weekend?</p>

<p>So, looking at ways that we can keep the home environment cool, even if it's just a single space, like the area that we sleep in, that can be very helpful.</p>
<p>因此，寻找方法保持家居环境凉爽，哪怕只是一个单独的空间，比如睡眠区域，也会非常有帮助。</p>
<p>So, if we have air conditioning, getting that activated if it's a portable air conditioner, dusting that off uh would be a good time to consider that now.</p>
<p>如果我们有空调，现在就是激活它的好时机，如果是便携式空调，清理一下灰尘。</p>

<p>And then taking some of the other measures that we can.</p>
<p>然后采取其他可行的措施。</p>
<p>So, using the shades or curtains to cool uh to cool the space, keeping the sun out during the day, and thinking ahead to if that's not enough within the home, cool areas in our communities, we can go to libraries, community centers, even cooler outdoor spaces can sometimes be safer than the high indoor temperatures, especially for people at very high risk.</p>
<p>使用遮阳帘或窗帘降温，白天遮挡阳光，如果家中不够凉爽，可以考虑社区中的凉爽区域，如图书馆、社区中心，甚至更凉爽的户外空间有时比高温的室内更安全，尤其是对高风险人群。</p>

<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>确实。</p>
<p>In in addition to some of those potentially devastating effects on communities, we know that the smoke from wildfires can have acute effects uh in the very short term and also longer term chronic effects as well that we're learning more and more about in the science.</p>

<p>So in the shorter run, people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease uh can experience exacerbations, worsenings of those conditions.</p>
<p>短期内，哮喘或慢性阻塞性肺病患者可能会出现病情加重。</p>

<p>So it's not just the our breathing that's impacted and we see science that more and more is finding that there can be risks to for example pregnancies the developing fetus uh and even effects on brain health over the longer term from repeated exposures.</p>

<p>So, if it's possible to create that in the home, if we have, for example, portable air filters or inbuilt air filtration at the home, that can be very helpful.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>So, uh, we're really trying to focus getting more trees in our urban core, which it has the the lower tree canopy, and we recognize the value of those trees because it's, um, it's tough in the Okonogan because people uh, have experienced wildfires and they're scared and often times people will blame the trees um around wildfires as as being a risk to them and their homes.</p>
<p>因此我们正努力在城市核心区种植更多树木，这些地区的树冠覆盖率较低，我们认识到这些树木的价值，因为在Okonogan地区，人们经历过野火并感到恐惧，常常将野火归咎于树木对其家园的威胁。</p>
<p>But we seeing more and more actual um proof that um trees that are broadleaf deciduous trees have actually helped protect homes in some of the wildfires in Los Angeles and and here in Colona as well.</p>

<p>So, we really want to encourage folks to not be afraid of trees, to pick the right ones and plant them in the right places, and they can actually help protect you and then they also cool our urban core and help reduce those temperatures that then lead to the higher fire risk here.</p>
<p>因此，我们真的想鼓励人们不要害怕树木，选择正确的树种并种植在合适的地方，它们实际上可以帮助保护你，还能降低城市中心的温度，从而减少火灾风险。</p>

<p>Good to hear from you in Campbell River and Dr. Schwant, Dr. Michael Schwand is with me, medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health.</p>
<p>很高兴听到你在坎贝尔河的分享，现在和我一起的是温哥华海岸卫生局的医疗健康官员Michael Schwand博士。</p>
<p>You know, Christian brought up the heat dome there that really affected virtually every part of the province.</p>
<p>Christian提到了热穹顶，它确实影响了全省几乎所有地区。</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1B2TazdEsy/?t=1879" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:31:19</span></a></h3>
<p>What are the lessons that can be learned from that deadly heat dome?</p>
<p>我们可以从那次致命的热穹顶中学到什么？</p>
<p>Very important event to to think about and to look at some of the the learnings that we have from that.</p>
<p>这是一个非常重要的事件，我们需要思考并从中吸取教训。</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, one of the biggest risks from the BC heat dome was that day on day and importantly night after night exposure to high heat.</p>
<p>首先，BC热穹顶的最大风险之一是持续的高温暴露，尤其是夜间高温。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1B2TazdEsy/?t=1897" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:31:37</span></a></h3>
<p>So, as Christian had mentioned, we really need housing that's able to uh to cool off and we're not relying only on overnight low temperatures because when we have a period of very high heat like the heat dome, we just weren't able to cool off in the night.</p>
<p>正如Christian提到的，我们确实需要能够降温的住房，不能仅仅依赖夜间低温，因为在像热穹顶这样的极端高温期间，我们无法在夜间降温。</p>
<p>So, we saw the temperatures just went up and up and up.</p>
<p>所以我们看到温度不断上升。</p>

<p>So, looking at the underlying infrastructure of our housing and how that can be cooler to begin to begin with is really important and that could be in the form of active cooling.</p>
<p>因此，研究住房的基础设施如何从一开始就更凉爽非常重要，这可以采取主动降温的形式。</p>
<p>So, things like air conditioning or heat pumps and then as a couple of callers have mentioned other measures that we can take as well.</p>
<p>比如空调或热泵，还有一些来电者提到的其他措施。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>some more passive measures uh are built right into the design of homes and also our neighborhoods uh the tree planting the greener urban neighborhoods that were described earlier are all all extremely important that can help to create cooler indoor spaces and again the home uh is really where we've seen most of that risk and then finally understanding who among our communities are at most risk during the heat we did see that older adults people with pre-existing conditions were at higher risk people who are socially isolated so taking the time as individuals and as community uh to reach out to those folks and provide uh provide assistance where necessary and again society to make sure that their uh that their risk is lower in the first place is very important.</p>
<p>一些更被动的措施直接融入住房和社区设计中，比如之前提到的植树和绿化城市社区，这些都非常重要，可以帮助创造更凉爽的室内空间。住房确实是风险最大的地方。最后，了解社区中哪些人在高温期间风险最高，我们发现老年人、有基础疾病的人和社交孤立的人风险更高，因此个人和社区需要花时间联系这些人并提供必要的帮助，同时社会也要确保他们的风险从一开始就降低。</p>
<p>Yeah, it' be a good time to read this email from Randy who writes, "Keep yourself cool and hydrated and check on those around you."</p>
<p>是的，现在是时候读一下Randy的邮件了，他写道：“保持凉爽和补水，并关心你周围的人。”</p>

<p>嗯，所以对喜欢续集的人并无恶意，但你能感觉到一种“续集病”正在席卷好莱坞。</p>
<p>Um, so why is that?</p>
<p>嗯，为什么会这样？</p>
<p>Well, when it comes to sequels, it's more about the dollars in terms of Hollywood having to take safe bets.</p>

<p>And if you know, well, as we know, uh, in the North American film industry, it's undergone a slew of challenges from from strikes to the California wildfires.</p>

<p>So, the industry, we could say, is in rebound at this point, in rebound mode.</p>
<p>所以可以说，目前这个行业正处于复苏阶段。</p>

<p>They're safe, best to draw in box office numbers.</p>

<p>这既对也不对。</p>
<p>It's untrue because I bet there are hundreds and thousands of screenwriters out there right now who have written a very brilliant script that just gets lost in the shuffle because Hollywood studios just don't want to get just don't want to bank on it.</p>
<p>不对是因为我敢打赌现在有成千上万的编剧写出了非常出色的剧本，但因为好莱坞制片厂不愿投资而被埋没。</p>

<p>Right.</p>
<p>没错。</p>
<p>So yeah, it's a matter of one giving it a chance and here's another here's another aspect of it too like Hollywood film making is also getting more and more expensive.</p>

<p>And the thing is, it's not really necessarily about how expensive a movie is in terms of it translating to success.</p>
<p>关键在于，电影的成功并不一定与它的成本挂钩。</p>
