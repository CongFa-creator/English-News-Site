<li><a href="#block-13">00:05:48 I'm Michelle Elliot.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-14">00:06:15 And right now there is breaking news.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-15">00:06:36 What do you think they need to accomplish?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-16">00:06:54 And now, as I mentioned, Israeli Emergency Services says sev</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-20">00:08:06 Um that facilities is a decently large complex.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:08:23 Um having said that that's not the only enrichment facility </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:08:45 So we're just in a very developing situation, hard to assess</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:08:58 So, just give us a sense of how difficult it is to get the i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:09:18 So, the material that would go inside of a nuclear weapon.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:09:40 Um what there are challenges around in terms of information </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:09:58 Uh intelligence communities might have a better sense, but i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:10:15 And Dolkova said that the latest intelligence assessment fro</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:10:39 And the Israeli military says dozens of Iranian missiles wer</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:11:01 And this is likely to be overshadowing the G7 summit that st</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:11:16 You can call us 1 800825-5950-669-3733.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:11:41 Good afternoon, Professor Tberian.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:12:02 Um, it will be a focus for sure.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:12:17 But this will be a big item because it has the potential to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:12:42 Uh and so the G7 probably will try to uh to deescalate to co</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:12:58 We urge all parties to refrain from actions that further des</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:13:17 So the main problem here is that Israel has a different view</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:13:37 So they're willing to go very very far and they're doing it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:13:51 Uh and so what is unknown now is whether Iran will be able t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:14:09 Uh Israel is extremely well defended against missiles and dr</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:14:27 You know, Israel now has disabled all the air defenses of Ir</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:14:44 Let's go live now um to uh a speaker on CBC News Network to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:15:07 Talks between Iran and the US were to resume in Oman this we</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:15:29 We must at all costs avoid a growing conflation that would h</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:15:49 Thank you for the opportunity.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:16:26 As I reported this morning to the IEA board of governors, we</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:17:00 This facility contains the fuel enrichment plant and the pil</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:17:27 Electricity infrastructure at the facility, an electrical su</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:17:57 However, we will continue to listen in to the comments and t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:18:26 So again, this is a very fastm moving uh story right now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:18:45 a number of issues will be raised including these uh increas</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:19:19 Our email is bctoday@cbc.ca.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:19:37 Today he urged Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:20:01 I believe that he uh no he has said all along that he did no</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:20:22 And by the way, Israel has the best weapons from the US and </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:20:46 That's the potential game that he's playing.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:21:06 The only good news from what I saw this morning is there wer</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:21:22 But here too I I assume that few uh Israelis will be killed </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:21:45 you know before this it was about how do you deal with uh Do</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:22:23 Well, so Mark Carney got a challenge for himself.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:22:42 They do global public goods.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:22:54 Uh there was a bit of an informal deadline between US and Ca</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:23:12 there would be uh you know a meeting between Mexico and the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:23:26 So those bilaterals will be extremely high intensity high sp</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:23:49 So there'll be a few things and then at the global level wha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:24:09 Um and we'll have to see uh what happens, what surprises he </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:24:32 There's a risk. You never know.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:24:53 But let's hear now from Tasha in Vancouver um who would like</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:25:12 I think those are important and it's a venue where you know </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:25:41 I always am skeptical about the costs of these gatherings fo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:26:04 I just, you know, we have people on our streets, don't have </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:26:19 Tasha, really interesting point there.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:26:39 So, you you will be um uh interrupted for two minutes, but y</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:26:57 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:27:19 Uh I believe that the majority of G7 agrees with Tasha here.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:27:36 That doesn't mean that the other countries cannot do all kin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:28:03 Uh because we're in the midst of a big change in the global </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:28:21 And war is much worse than uh paying for a summit.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:28:41 Um what would you be looking for coming out of the summit?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:28:57 So there will be some working groups, some initiatives but a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:29:18 Unfortunately, 77% of Canadian exports go to the US and we'r</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:29:36 It's very good to speak with you today.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:29:59 Stay with us.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-86">00:31:03 The warning covers areas including Fort Nelson, Peace River,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:31:20 It says the convention is the largest ever event for biotech</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:31:37 And taking a look now at the BC weather along the north coas</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:31:53 For the southeast, increasing clouds, a chance of showers or</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:32:09 And now back to Michelle Elliot and BC today.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-127">00:42:03 So it's it's great to see that that kind of change taking pl</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-128">00:42:15 Masculinity is not just like you know not crying and shaking</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-129">00:42:27 This is this is new new information.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-132">00:43:15 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:43:29 That's so true.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-134">00:43:40 As long as they don't hold it over you later.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-135">00:43:50 Not so good.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-136">00:44:02 So, let let us know.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-153">00:49:04 I just, you know, for me, my dad is, he knows because he's a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-154">00:49:21 and he tells me about some people get on the bike needs help</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-155">00:50:05 You could always go over and ask him for helpings, but this </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-156">00:50:17 And I know that, you know, with modern parenting, I can only</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-157">00:50:35 H Roy, if you don't don't mind me asking, what's your dad's </a></li>

<p>But here too I I assume that few uh Israelis will be killed that that allow us to contain the crisis.</p>

<p>you know before this it was about how do you deal with uh Donald Trump um and this may still be an issue uh you know we know that there will be no joint statement or communicate at the end of of the summit as there is traditionally at the last summit in Charlavois the um that joint statement in the end uh President Trump um reneged from it or pulled away from it um because of the sort of tit tit for tat between him uh Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the time and Trump.</p>
<p>此前焦点是如何应对特朗普，这仍是问题。我们知道本次峰会结束时不会像传统那样发表联合声明——上次夏尔瓦峰会因特朗普与时任总理特鲁多的争执导致他最终退出联合声明。</p>

<p>Well, so Mark Carney got a challenge for himself.</p>
<p>马克·卡尼面临巨大挑战。</p>
<p>He's dealing with one of the highest intensity cocktail of uh you know geopolitical and geo economic crisis that any G7 had to deal with.</p>

<p>there would be uh you know a meeting between Mexico and the US.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>Um I think modern fatherhood is is you know changed a little bit just in the fact that I think that dads are more present and um they're making an effort to you know be as involved as the moms are and be an equal partner in the in the parenting which I I think is hugely important and uh adds just a ton more value to the to the job and life of being a parent.</p>
<p>现代父亲角色变化在于父亲更多参与育儿，努力与母亲平等分担，这极为重要，也让为人父母更有价值。</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>There's so much more.</p>

<p>过去做父亲可能只需在孩子18岁时教打领带，其他时候基本放养。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>And what's changed for you?</p>
<p>你有什么变化？</p>
<p>Well, a couple of points.</p>
<p>几点变化。</p>
<p>One thing that's changed is when uh my first daughter was born, this is decades ago, and I would take her down to Kits Beach and you know in the in the baby carriage and almost every other parent there was a mother.</p>
<p>几十年前我带第一个女儿去基茨海滩，婴儿车里基本都是妈妈们。</p>

<p>Now you see at least as many fathers as mothers with their babies and that's such a great change.</p>
<p>现在看到带孩子的父亲和母亲一样多，这变化很棒。</p>
<p>Um and um another another thing is that what patriarchy has done in the past anyway has separated fathers from children.</p>
<p>父权制曾让父亲与孩子疏离。</p>
<p>So the fathers and the children miss out on the wonderful connections they could have.</p>
<p>双方都错失了美好联结。</p>
