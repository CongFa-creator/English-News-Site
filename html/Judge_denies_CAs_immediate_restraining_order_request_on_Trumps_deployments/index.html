<p>这是对紧急请求而非整体请求的驳回。与此同时，抗议者今晚再次走上街头，反对即将在洛杉矶展开的ICE突查行动。目前特朗普总统正试图在全国范围内围捕更多无证移民。</p>

<p>It's pretty simple. We don't want to see one. We don't want to see Los Angeles burned to the ground.</p>

<p>Totally get that. One of the reasons why President Trump was elected is because of the criminal eleme And if we if we focus on that, i going to take all hands on deck for us to get that accomplished.</p>
<p>理解这点。特朗普当选部分源于他对犯罪问题的重视。若我们集中精力于此，需全员配合方能达成目标。</p>

<p>But to go back to some of the cr we heard, oh, just now I'm heari use that nickname for his, derogatory nickname for Gavin Ne He's repeatedly now brought up Los Angeles.</p>
<p>他多次用贬义绰号称呼纽瑟姆，并反复提及洛杉矶局势。</p>
<p>He's referred to both the govern and the mayor as incompetent.</p>
<p>他指责州长和市长无能。</p>
<p>He argues that Los Angeles would be burning if it weren't for him, that he believes that the govern does not have the right to try and push back and criticize the federal government here, and his decision to bring troops to Los Angeles to deal with this</p>

<p>And I think what I was surprised by is just it did seem like the governor wa ill prepared because, as you mentioned in your monolog you know, in 2020, Donald Trump wanted to invoke the Insurrectio previous advisers.</p>
<p>令人惊讶的是州长准备不足——如您所述，2020年特朗普曾考虑动用《反叛乱法》。</p>
<p>I was in the meeting when it was discussed, convinced him he didn't need to because federal law enforcement would be able to get the job don of crowd control.</p>
<p>我参与过相关会议，当时说服他无需动用该法，因联邦执法部门能控制局势。</p>

<p>And I think what Newsom should have been communicating, and perhaps he was we know there were two brief conversations, is I can get the job done of bringing back the piece, controlling the streets without bringing in these National Guardsmen and these Marines.</p>
<p>纽瑟姆本应明确传达——据知有过两次简短对话——他能在不调用国民警卫队和海军陆战队情况下恢复秩序。</p>
<p>So, right now, Donald Trump is feeling confiden if not cocky. He thinks that he's playing kind of a winning card here, and he's hoping to bait Democrats, especially Newsom, into stepping in the trap that they did in 2020 of calling for defunding calling for defunding the police and even potentially having an altercation, God forbi with some of these service membe</p>
<p>目前特朗普信心十足，试图诱使民主党人——特别是纽瑟姆——重蹈2020年"削减警费"覆辙，甚至可能引发与军人的冲突。</p>

<p>他认为自己占据优势，但需警惕局势可能迅速恶化。</p>
<p>So again, there's all sorts of 2 implications here. But it's a fight Donald Trump wanted to pick. And he thinks he's winning right</p>
<p>此事涉及多重影响，但这是特朗普主动挑起的斗争，且他认为自己目前占优。</p>
