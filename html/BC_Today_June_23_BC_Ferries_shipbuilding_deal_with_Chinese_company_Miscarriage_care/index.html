<li><a href="#block-12">00:05:17 He said the conversation focused on deescalating the conflic</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-13">00:06:25 BC Today is up next.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-14">00:08:09 Well, do you think it needs to revisit the decision?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-15">00:08:24 UBC's Dr. Deborah Money will join us.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-16">00:08:45 BC fairies awarded the contract to China merchants industry </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:09:22 I would like your assurance that BC Fairies conducted a robu</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:09:47 She asked forworth to confirm with quote utmost certainty th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:10:08 And he said cancelling the contract at this stage would come</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:10:29 feel like the ship construction contract uh for BC fairies u</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:11:21 That's Eric McNeely, president of the BC Marine Ferry and Ma</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:11:37 What about the politics around this story?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:12:00 Stuart, thanks so much for being with us.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:12:18 He said based on the overall strength of its bid.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:12:34 Well, I think there is uh a heightened sensitivity around tr</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:12:58 So I think anytime we see a significant uh contract involvin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:13:40 But but of course the other uh imperative for governments is</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:14:29 But it is supposed to act like an independent corporation th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:14:59 And so so we have a sense where the NDP uh lost the ensuing </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:15:35 My understanding is that the the other competitive bids comi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:15:59 uh points to other areas of tension where we do have federal</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:16:27 So that's a really interesting point you make.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:16:50 What do you make of the criticism and what do you make of th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:17:10 I see lots of emails coming in now, too.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:17:21 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:17:46 I understand the Germans uh were more expensive but also muc</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:18:04 That way they would have replaced all of the C-class and the</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:18:20 Um, but what about that that call to have um a Canadian comp</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:18:50 The two shipyards, one on the east coast and one on the west</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:19:19 So, okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:19:37 Well, you can look at it all you want.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:19:55 Okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:20:24 So was there really an equal a level playing field here?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:20:45 In some ways, this would be the the perfect uh globalized po</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:21:05 Now we are in this new world.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:21:30 But certainly we could work towards it in the future.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:22:11 It is the the new workshop of the world, we can't simply ign</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:22:28 1 800 825-59-50604-669-3733.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:22:51 She said, "Why did I bother voting NDP? My own response, I w</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:23:11 Do you think any of that has plays a role here in the kind o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:24:00 So I don't know that there is an easy way out for the govern</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:24:21 Hi Ralph, are you there?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:24:47 These fairies are faster, quieter, and perfect for connectin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:25:09 Okay, thank you for that point.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:25:16 Thanks for calling in.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:25:36 And at the same time, I think that the federal government ha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:26:00 Um I wouldn't say interference.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:26:25 I take your point.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:26:55 Um and uh while she notes that the federal government helps </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:27:14 You know, the extent of the role that um that the federal go</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:28:01 And so I I think there is a certain amount of uh of uh of wh</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:28:18 So so there there is that performative aspect as well.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:28:26 Hi.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:29:10 The BC government would say to the workers, "We're going to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:29:22 Thank you very much.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:29:38 So I wonder if that's where the conversation goes now too.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:29:47 Michelle Steuart Press, political scientist at UBC.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:30:07 Iranian state TV called the attack a quote might and success</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:30:25 Bezad Abdi is with the Tri City Iranian Cultural Society.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:30:42 Many Iranians view the Islamic regime as a source of oppress</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:31:04 M but at the same time we are also deeply concerned like any</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:31:24 Yes, no one wants bloodshed.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:32:08 Very good to have you with us this Monday afternoon.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:32:25 We're going to talk to a professor at UBC and we'll ask you </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:32:42 Qatar says it intercepted an Iranian missile attack on a US </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:33:02 Iran says it launched the same number of missiles the US use</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:33:17 A woman from Calgary was also killed. Three others were inju</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:33:37 Between Friday and Sunday, some areas logged up to 50 millim</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:33:53 In the central interior, including Prince George, a high of </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:34:07 And for Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, and the Fraser Va</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:34:25 All right. Well, the NBA finals wrapped up last night. The O</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:34:50 The only other three people to do it, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, M</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:35:05 It's hard to even fathom that I'm that type of basketball pl</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:35:26 I wouldn't be able to done without them. They know exactly w</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:35:52 I remember it like it was yesterday. So exciting.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:36:41 Early pregnancy loss occurs in about 15% of pregnancies but </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:37:03 We'll talk to a UBC professor of obstetrics and gynecology i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:37:25 Our email address is bctoday@cbc.ca.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:37:49 My guest is Dr. Dr. Deborah Money, a professor of obstetrics</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:38:03 I know this is a really difficult conversation. Um but and p</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:38:29 So, um so when pregnancy losses happen, they're kind of sile</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:38:52 Yeah. What's it like for you as a care provider?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:39:20 Yeah, it's so difficult. And and how lacking is is that supp</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:39:49 Um women need support. Women need to um be heard.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:40:10 Um so when it comes to these guidelines, can you tell me abo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:40:34 But probably more remarkable for some of our classic medical</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:40:54 What are the the recommendations and what are they suggestin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:41:14 The other the other recommendation which um is for more dedi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:41:53 Well, quite often, um if there is significant bleeding perha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:42:15 Um we do fortunately have one early pregnancy assessment cli</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:42:39 Well, I think in every um hospital and health authority, one</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:43:10 Uh that's I think worth considering. uh we need to probably </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:43:30 We are talking about new guidelines for miscarriage care and</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-104">00:44:00 The BC mental health support line is 3106789.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-105">00:44:20 Can you tell me a bit about that?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:44:40 And so that can really affect somebody individuals can be ve</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:45:04 Recognizing that not every woman or person who can get pregn</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:45:24 And so what can family and friends do to be more compassiona</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:45:55 It's different for every person how they react to it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:46:12 And I think that's been a bit of a tendency.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:46:33 In terms of saying if you were to tell people that you were </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-112">00:46:50 Oh, that's interesting having and I wonder if primary caregi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:47:06 And Lindsay has called us from Vancouver.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:47:37 And I I I was just each time that happened I was just devast</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:47:57 Yeah I'm sorry for that that experience.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:48:17 I wow to have to be surrounded by that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:48:38 I think what these guidelines are calling out is for all of </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:48:59 It's tough cuz not every facility has dedicated space.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-119">00:49:31 It's more typically a later miscarriage or loss at a later a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-120">00:49:56 Hi Tom.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-121">00:50:17 It's not a child it's not something to mourn until it's born</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-122">00:50:41 So we need to see this as as a loss of an infant to the moth</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-123">00:50:58 What what do you make of that?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-124">00:51:17 And that needs to be distinguished from the legality of the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-125">00:51:48 Medically what are the ways to improve care for miscarriage </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-126">00:52:08 In some cases we now have medications that are able to be us</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-127">00:52:31 But now we have a bit more option than we did many years ago</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-128">00:52:53 Hi thank you very much.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-129">00:53:21 Or Oh well there must have been something wrong with the fet</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-130">00:53:50 Lea I hear the grief in you recounting that and I'm so sorry</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-131">00:54:09 Those are things that I would imagine are so painful to hear</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-132">00:54:28 We have to validate the grief around that and support women </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:54:49 I can really hear it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-134">00:55:08 Let's take another call here now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-135">00:55:22 Sure thing and what do you want to say about improving misca</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-136">00:55:43 That in itself if people aren't expecting that they might no</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-137">00:56:13 What an important point.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-138">00:56:32 As a licensed funeral director I can help people who might h</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-139">00:57:02 What a salient point Christa thank you very much for that ca</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-140">00:57:27 We need to be as care providers counseling perhaps.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-141">00:57:52 So that's often a shock and a difficult thing to sort of cop</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-142">00:58:14 So I think it's wonderful that we have funeral directors tha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-143">00:58:32 What will it take to have them be implemented?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-144">00:58:55 How could we do this better?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-145">00:59:11 So, it's opening the conversation which I think is so import</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-146">00:59:28 I really want to thank our callers who joined us and shared </a></li>
