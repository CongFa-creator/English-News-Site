<p>Overnight, Israel and Iran continued to attack each other.</p>
<p>昨夜，以色列和伊朗持续互相攻击。</p>
<p>The message we heard from European foreign ministers here yesterday, including the foreign secretary, David Lammy, was that there is this very narrow window now for diplomacy before President Donald Trump will look again at that military pan that he said to have approved and possibly order military strikes.</p>
<p>昨天包括外交大臣戴维·拉米在内的欧洲外长们表示，在特朗普总统重新考虑他已批准的军事计划并可能下令军事打击前，外交窗口期非常短暂。</p>

<p>It is the first time that an Iranian drone has made direct impact since the beginning of this conflict.</p>

<p>The place is called Bet Shan and it is we believe the first time certainly in the week of this round of the conflict that a drone has actually got through and caused damage.</p>
