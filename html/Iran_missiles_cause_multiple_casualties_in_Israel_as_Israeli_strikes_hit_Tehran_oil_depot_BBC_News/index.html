<p>英国首相斯塔默称正增派台风战机及空中加油机赴中东。</p>
<p>The Prime Minister told reporters he's neither ruling in nor out the prospect of British jets helping Israel to respond to Iran's strikes, as happened in April and October last year.</p>
<p>首相表示不排除英军战机协助以方反击伊朗的可能性，类似去年4月及10月的情况。</p>

<p>I'll read it to you now.</p>
<p>内容如下：</p>
<p>The US had nothing to do with the attack on Iran tonight.</p>
<p>美国与今夜袭伊行动无关。</p>
<p>If we are attacked in any way, shape, or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the US armed forces will come down on you at levels never seen before.</p>
<p>若伊朗以任何形式攻击美国，美军将以空前力度回击。</p>
<p>However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel and end this bloody conflict.</p>
<p>但美方可促成伊以协议终结冲突。</p>

<p>And Hugo, just bring us up to date on the injuries and casualties from those overnight strikes.</p>
<p>请介绍夜间袭击的最新伤亡情况。</p>
<p>Yeah, Nikki.</p>
<p>好的。</p>

<p>The second night of Iranian attacks across Israel.</p>
<p>全国响起警报提示导弹威胁。</p>
<p>We had sirens uh across the country and uh obviously you know alerting people of the uh threat coming from those missiles.</p>
<p>首波袭击中导弹击中北部巴勒斯坦裔聚居城镇塔姆拉的居民区。</p>
<p>So in the first wave of attacks a missile hit a residential area in the town of Tamra which is a mainly Palestinian town uh in the north of the country.</p>

<p>A house partially collapsed.</p>
<p>遇难者疑似同家族女性。</p>
<p>At least four people were killed there and it seems that all the victims are women from the same family.</p>
<p>数小时后第二波袭击来袭。</p>
<p>Then hours later there was a second wave of attacks.</p>
<p>耶路撒冷听到巨大爆炸声。</p>
<p>We heard loud explosions here in Jerusalem as the air defense systems tried to intercept those missiles and a missile hit a residential building uh in the city of Batyam uh in the central part of Israel.</p>
<p>防空系统试图拦截导弹，巴特亚姆市居民楼被击中。</p>

<p>How is the fact that across Israel now they are seeing those pictures on their televisions of those buildings that have been destroyed?</p>
<p>民众通过电视看到建筑被毁画面的影响如何？</p>

<p>What impact is that going to have on Israelis?</p>
<p>这对以色列民众有何影响？</p>
<p>Well, I think you know people here were I think expecting that this could happen because the Israeli authorities since the beginning of this uh campaign on Friday were alerting people that they were expecting uh a huge Iranian response with missiles and drones and they were telling the people to stay alert to follow the uh instructions by the authorities to seek shelter uh you know during those attacks.</p>
<p>当地民众对此早有预期，因为以色列当局自周五行动开始就警告称，伊朗可能以导弹和无人机大规模反击，并呼吁民众保持警惕，遵循当局指示在袭击期间寻求庇护。</p>

<p>I wondered if I could pick up on one of the points that Hugo uh made there, the fact that in these latest strikes, Israel appears to be targeting the fuel operation uh oil depots and other areas in Iran.</p>
<p>我想追问雨果提到的观点：以军最新空袭似乎针对伊朗燃料设施、石油仓库等目标。</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>确实如此。</p>
<p>They've really now broadened out the attacks beyond just what was the initial stuff on the actual nuclear program itself, hitting actual sites and then the targeted assassinations of key personnel in the military and in the nuclear program.</p>

<p>This is now quite a bit wider.</p>

<p>Do we have any idea yet of the scale of the damage that has been done across Iran and in particular at those nuclear sites that you mentioned?</p>
<p>目前能否评估伊朗境内尤其是核设施的受损程度？</p>
<p>So, it is still early days and it's probably going to take some time before we have a a very accurate picture.</p>

<p>That's right.</p>

<p>Clearly they're doing this in stages.</p>
<p>显然他们在分阶段推进。</p>
<p>Um there were a number of nuclear sites particularly that at Fordo and Isvahan that weren't hit in the initial wave of attacks and have been since.</p>
<p>福尔多与伊斯法罕等核设施未在首轮遭袭但后续被打击。</p>

<p>The key question will be whether any of those attacks go a little further and hit non-Israeli uh targets.</p>
<p>关键在于会否波及非以色列目标。</p>
<p>So hit American or perhaps even British interests in the region.</p>
<p>例如攻击美英在地区利益。</p>
<p>And that will depend on the degree to which Iran perceives US and other western states as actually facilitating these attacks on the part of Israel.</p>
