<p>Summary:
Reports emerge of another fatal incident near a Gaza aid distribution center, with Hamas-run civil defense claiming Israeli troops killed 27 people. The IDF states it fired warning shots at suspects deviating from designated routes and is investigating casualty reports. This marks the second mass casualty event in three days amid chaotic aid distribution under a new Israeli-controlled system replacing UN methods, drawing criticism for forcing civilians into military zones and risking forced displacement.</p>
<p>摘要：
加沙援助分发中心附近又发生致命事件，哈马斯管理的民防机构称以军打死27人。以军称向偏离路线的嫌疑人鸣枪示警并正调查伤亡报告。这是三天内第二起大规模伤亡事件，以方新设的替代联合国体系的援助分发模式因迫使平民进入军事区并可能造成强制迁移而遭批评。</p>

<p>Reports are emerging of another fatal incident near a distribution center in Gaza.</p>
<p>加沙一个分发中心附近又发生致命事件的报道正在浮现。</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Hamas-run civil defense agency says Israeli troops killed 27 people, including a woman, about a kilometer away from the site in the southern part of the strip.</p>
<p>哈马斯管理的民防机构发言人称以军在飞地南部距该地点约一公里处打死27人，包括一名女性。</p>

<p>Israel Defense Forces have released a statement saying their troops identified several suspects moving toward them deviating from designated access routes.</p>
<p>以色列国防军发表声明称其部队发现多名嫌疑人偏离指定通道向他们移动。</p>
<p>It says it fired warning shots and after the suspects failed to retreat, additional shots were directed near a few individuals advancing towards the troops.</p>
<p>声明称部队鸣枪示警后因嫌疑人未撤退，向继续逼近的少数人附近追加射击。</p>

<p>The IDF says it's aware of reports regarding casualties and it's looking into that.</p>
<p>以军表示已知晓伤亡报告并正在调查。</p>
<p>It says it's not preventing civilians from accessing aid sites.</p>
<p>以军称并未阻止平民进入援助点。</p>
<p>Our Middle East correspondent Barbara Pasha is in Jerusalem and gave us the latest.</p>
<p>本台中东记者芭芭拉·帕夏在耶路撒冷发回最新消息。</p>
<p>This is the second time in three days that a lot of Palestinians, dozens of Palestinians have been killed while trying to get aid from this new distribution system that has set up hubs in southern Gaza.</p>
<p>这是三天内第二次发生大批巴勒斯坦人（数十人）在试图从加沙南部新设立的援助分发枢纽获取物资时遇难。</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1V27vzSEUR/?t=64" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:01:04</span></a></h3>
<p>So, just to set the scene, this is the Palestinians gather about a kilometer away quite early in the morning until they're allowed to move forward to the hubs and they have to pass through territory that is controlled by the Israeli military because the Israeli military is securing these aid hubs.</p>
<p>具体场景是：巴勒斯坦人清晨聚集在约一公里外，待获准前进时必须穿过以军控制的区域——因这些援助枢纽由以军把守。</p>
<p>With the UN, the aid is brought to their homes or brought to their communities.</p>
<p>联合国体系下援助物资会送至居民家中或社区。</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1V27vzSEUR/?t=87" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:01:27</span></a></h3>
<p>This is a different system and it means that civilians are put in quite close proximity to Israeli soldiers for this period while they're getting to the aid hub and I think that's the context for what we've been seeing in the last couple of days.</p>
<p>新体系不同，意味着平民获取援助期间需极度靠近以军士兵，这正是近日事件发生的背景。</p>
<p>So what we're hearing is that 24 Palestinians were killed as they were gathering to head towards the aid site.</p>
<p>据悉有24名巴勒斯坦人在集结前往援助点时遇难。</p>

<p>We don't have details yet on the circumstances of why that happened.</p>
<p>事件具体原因尚不明确。</p>
<p>We do have a report from the Israeli army that said it did fire at a number of people suspects it calls them that left the designated route and didn't pay attention to warning shots, but it does not have an answer for the number of casualties that we're seeing at the hospital where the bodies and dead are being brought.</p>
<p>以军报告承认向多名被其称为"嫌疑人"的偏离路线且无视警告射击者开火，但无法解释医院接收的大量伤亡。</p>

<p>So, it says it's checking into those reports.</p>
<p>以军称正在核查这些报告。</p>
<p>And this then is adding to the criticism of how this new style of aid delivery is operating.</p>
<p>这加剧了对新援助模式运作方式的批评。</p>
<p>Yes. So the idea of this new aid system according to the Israelis is that you needed to have secure hubs for the aid to be distributed by a private company that essentially sidelines the UN.</p>
<p>以方称新体系需由私营公司在安全枢纽分发援助，实质上边缘化联合国。</p>

<p>But its argument is that Hamas has been stealing aid and so therefore you need to have a secure spot where Palestinians will be able to get the aid.</p>
<p>其理由是哈马斯一直在窃取援助，因此需设立安全分发点。</p>
<p>Having I have to say they haven't really provided proof that this is happening in any large way and UN officials have consistently said it's really armed criminal gangs that is stealing aid that is looting the aid not Hamas but this is the rationale that the Israelis give so it means that the Palestinians have to walk to these aid hubs to get their food like I said normally under the UN system the food was brought to their communities it there aren't that many of these hubs so they have to walk a long way they are have to wait at these just at these junctions before they're allowed to move towards the sites and as I mentioned they go through these these areas where these really military it's a military zone basically.</p>
<p>需指出以方未充分证实该情况，联合国官员始终表示是武装犯罪团伙而非哈马斯在掠夺援助。但以方以此为由要求巴勒斯坦人长途步行至稀少的分发枢纽——与联合国送物资上门的模式不同，且需在军事管制区等候通行。</p>

<p>Another one is that there doesn't seem to be organized distribution.</p>
<p>另一问题是分发缺乏组织性。</p>
<p>So from pictures we've seen the accounts we've heard from many people is that the boxes of food and millions of meals are being distributed but the the foundation says but the boxes of food are kind of piled in these aid distribution centers and people sort of run to get there because it's first come first serve.</p>
<p>据影像资料和民众描述，成堆的食品箱虽在分发，但采取"先到先得"的混乱争抢模式。</p>

<p>And that also adds to the chaos.</p>
<p>这进一步加剧混乱。</p>
<p>And the other criticism which has been from the beginning before they even started operating is that the UN says if you're demanding that Palestinians go to a particular place to get aid, it could amount to something like force displacement because they have to come from different parts of the Gaza Strip to the south, which is where the aid distribution centers are set up.</p>
<p>另一项从运作前就存在的批评是：联合国认为强制巴勒斯坦人前往南部固定地点获取援助可能构成变相强制迁移。</p>

<p>The organization that is running these centers says it's planning to build more and we'll see what happens in the coming days.</p>
<p>运营方称计划增设枢纽，成效有待观察。</p>
<p>But the model is very very different from the UN and frankly from the international humanitarian model.</p>
<p>该模式与联合国及国际人道主义标准截然不同。</p>
<p>Something that a senior UN official has called a wildly unhumanitarian way of doing things.</p>
<p>联合国高官称之为"极度非人道"的运作方式。</p>

<p>Now, there is one aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that was open over the past few days and it's one of four that was set up in the strip, but there's clear confusion over how Palestinians on the ground can access aid and we've seen chaotic scenes of people trying to access aid rushing towards the site.</p>
