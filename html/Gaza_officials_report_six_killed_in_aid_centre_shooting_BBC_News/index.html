<p>First, she told us more about this latest shooting incident.</p>
<p>她首先详细介绍了最新的枪击事件。</p>
<p>Well, Lewis, it happened um at a roundabout in southern Gaza where Palestinians gather uh before the aid distribution site opens.</p>
<p>Lewis，事件发生在加沙南部一处环岛，巴勒斯坦人常在援助分发点开放前聚集于此。</p>

<p>So, this is the place where we've had those shootings earlier in the week.</p>
<p>本周早些时候的枪击事件也发生在此地。</p>
<p>People gather, tens of thousands of them waiting for access to this distribution site.</p>
<p>数万人聚集等待进入该分发点。</p>
<p>Uh and then in the process of getting to it uh there have been firings uh and shootings and dozens have been killed, hundreds injured.</p>
<p>在前往过程中发生交火和枪击，已致数十人死亡、数百人受伤。</p>

<p>Um now what happened uh it sounds like something similar.</p>
<p>此次事件听起来类似。</p>
<p>Uh the an eyewitness the the civil defense agency said that the Israelis had opened fire on the crowd.</p>
<p>民防机构称目击者指认以色列向人群开火。</p>
<p>Um what the Israelis said was they had warned the Gazins that they that this area outside the distribution center was a combat zone from 6:00 in the evening to 6:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>以色列方表示已警告加沙民众，分发中心外围区域在晚6点至早6点为交战区。</p>

<p>uh and that several individuals had approached them in a threatening manner and they had opened fire with warning shots.</p>
<p>数人以威胁姿态靠近，以军遂鸣枪警告。</p>
<p>They said there they were aware of the reports of the casualties.</p>
<p>以军称已知晓伤亡报告。</p>
<p>Now, this is a similar scenario to what they talked about on Tuesday when many more Palestinians were killed, that they had fired at suspects that veered toward them and didn't pay attention uh to warning shots.</p>
<p>这与周二导致更多巴勒斯坦人死亡的场景相似——以军称当时向无视警告继续靠近的嫌疑人开火。</p>

<p>So, this is quite a a volatile area for the Palestinians to have to wait and pass through to get to the aid distribution site.</p>
<p>因此，巴勒斯坦人等待和通过以获取援助的区域局势高度紧张。</p>
<p>the the company or the organization that runs this these distribution centers shut things down for a bit this week trying to improve this the centers trying to improve because there's been massive overcrowding and also to improve the safety um but it looks as if there's still that kind of dynamic uh where the Palestinians who gather for for food in the morning um are are in danger of either death or injury.</p>
<p>运营这些分发中心的组织本周曾短暂关闭以改善设施（因严重拥挤）并提升安全性，但清晨聚集领取食物的巴勒斯坦人仍面临伤亡风险。</p>

<p>And Barbara, given the similarities to those previous incidents that you are outlining there and the criticism of this particular aid operation from many international organizations through the week, how damaging will these reports be?</p>
<p>鉴于事件与先前类似且本周多国组织批评该援助行动，这些报道将造成多大负面影响？</p>
<p>Well, I don't think they're going to improve the reputation of this model of distribution.</p>
<p>我认为这无助于提升该分发模式的声誉。</p>

<p>Um what there have been many criticisms as you said from international aid organizations and from the UN but the ones that deal with how effective it is have pointed out that the the the way that they distribute aid international aid organizations is to take the food supplies to the communities and deliver them according to like a registration list to the people that they know uh need it uh in an orderly way.</p>
<p>如您所言，国际援助组织和联合国提出诸多批评，尤其指出现行模式效率低下——常规做法是按登记名单有序向社区直接配送。</p>
<p>This is quite a different model because it requires Palestinians to come to several big distribution hubs which means they have to travel from different parts of the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>现行模式要求巴勒斯坦人前往数个大型分发中心，需从加沙各地长途跋涉。</p>

<p>Some of them walk for hours, which means they have to gather at a certain point uh until they're allowed in and which creates these security issues uh we we've been seeing because at least in this southern this southern um uh hub, they have to pass through an Israeli military zone which puts them in close proximity with Israeli soldiers.</p>
<p>有人步行数小时聚集等候准入，由此引发安全风险——在南部枢纽需穿越以军管控区，与士兵近距离接触。</p>
<p>So uh as I said there there were efforts this week to try to improve the the situation and how it works.</p>

<p>But given that something similar has happened again, that isn't going to uh stop the criticism.</p>
<p>但类似事件重演将无法平息批评。</p>
<p>And Barbara, let's move to the second significant development, the recovery of that body by the Israeli forces.</p>
<p>请谈谈以军寻获遗体的另一重要进展。</p>
<p>Yes. Um the Israeli uh army said that it had recovered the body of uh Nutapang Pinta from uh the the area of Rafa in southern Gaza.</p>
