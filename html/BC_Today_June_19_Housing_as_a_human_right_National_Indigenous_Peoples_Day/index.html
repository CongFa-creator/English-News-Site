<li><a href="#block-2">00:01:39 The president hiked the US tariff rate on steel and aluminum</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-3">00:01:55 Carney also said he's working on a new tariff rate.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-4">00:02:12 And the BC New Democrats have now sent a letter to the RCMP.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-10">00:04:06 So, that means uh the cent's 50 meter pool will be replaced </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-11">00:04:23 Definitely they need to improve a little bit the the area be</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-13">00:05:09 BC Today is coming up next. Good afternoon. Thank you for jo</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-16">00:08:25 Now, the call comes amidst the housing affordability crisis </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:08:41 And what measures would it take to guarantee housing for eve</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:09:04 Sean our is a Vancouver counselor and joins me now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:09:20 We've been hearing calls from BC's human rights commissioner</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:09:37 Well um you know exactly that you mentioned that it was uh i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:09:59 you know, it doesn't matter what city it comes from. Whoever</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:10:19 Housing is a human right. And you know, this is on this is t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:10:57 And now as as you know, we're seeing the latest stats BC lik</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:11:14 Well, I mean this would be a legal framework, right? So this</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:11:43 No, absolutely. But I mean, you know, this would this would </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:12:11 um you know if they're being evicted because of a pet or or </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:12:30 So what about municipalities treating housing as a human rig</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:12:49 So, this would this would just put us both on the same page,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:13:08 You know, municipalities can't do things like, you know, vac</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:13:30 Similarly, the right for for for tenants to organize collect</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:13:52 Sean or is with me Vancouver city councelor and we're taking</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:14:08 Um what are the measures that you want to see that would gua</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:14:28 What are your thoughts on housing as a human right?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:14:46 And I think a huge chunk of it comes down to uh the commodif</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:15:04 Thank you very much um for that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:15:37 That's the million-dollar question and I'm glad uh your call</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:15:52 I think this is kind of now a common uh piece of knowledge.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:16:08 You know it's we've got a lot of great protections in this p</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:16:36 And this is this is this would contribute to to public safet</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:16:51 Hi Jean Mark.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:17:10 So, what what are the practical steps do you think that need</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:17:25 So, it's going to be a campus that is essentially a massive </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:17:43 So, it's trained for the future.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:17:57 Mhm.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:18:35 We're the best city to live in in the world.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:18:49 But the homes could be produced and significantly cheaper th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:19:02 I can see councelor or nodding along as he's listening to yo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:19:18 So I agree with the speaker that supports that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:19:39 They want to put 25 foot or 25 floor towers in.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:20:17 So, it's got to be affordable and it has to fit the communit</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:20:27 Hi Brent.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:20:46 There's been a crackdown on people uh living in camper vans,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:20:58 Not only parks, but generally uh there people parked in back</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:21:18 They're dead wrong on that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:21:38 And should that be included as we think about what are the t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:21:56 Um and and and that caller brings up some incredible points </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:22:08 So, and and we saw, you know, in Crab Park in Vancouver, we </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:22:30 And that would include uh all those different forms of housi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:22:51 So sometimes a house a house a tent is a house um for a lot </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:23:12 So how should that approach what should that approach be the</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:23:48 But, you know, there's that's where the other levels of gove</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:24:12 So, okay, it just it's going to be all hands on deck.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:24:26 I am fine.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:24:45 You need food, water, clothing, and shelter to survive.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:25:20 Okay. So um what we need to do first and foremost is limit t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:26:05 So if there I agree with you that they are providing a servi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:26:26 But they're buying up they're buying up entire swaps and ent</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:26:52 Um and our next caller is is uh jumping off of that as well.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:27:14 And what happened was this hasn't been going on all along. T</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:27:34 And there's now a class action lawsuit proposed to stop them</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:27:56 The only solution because the REITs keep outbreing outbeddin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:28:18 Yeah. So that's one that's a really really important point a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:29:08 Okay. U, as I mentioned in the beginning. So, I'll leave it </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:29:42 Annabel Wright says, "We purchased a small condo in Victoria</a></li>

<p>[Music] Hey everyone, it's Thursday, June 19th.</p>
<p>[音乐] 大家好，今天是6月19日星期四。</p>
<p>I'm Venique Bright here in the CBC Vancouver newsroom.</p>
<p>我是CBC温哥华新闻编辑室的Venique Bright。</p>
<p>Here's what's happening this afternoon.</p>
<p>以下是今天下午的最新动态。</p>
<p>Well, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced new measures today to help stabilize Canada's steel and aluminum sectors that have been hit hard by Donald Trump's tariffs.</p>
<p>加拿大总理马克·卡尼今日宣布新措施，以稳定受唐纳德·特朗普关税重创的钢铁和铝业。</p>

<p>The president hiked the US tariff rate on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%.</p>
<p>总统将美国对钢铁和铝的关税从25%提高至50%。</p>
<p>That was earlier this month.</p>
<p>这一调整发生在本月初。</p>
<p>Well, now Carney is also signaling that he's willing to go higher with Canada's retaliatory response if the countries don't reach a trade deal in a month.</p>
<p>卡尼还表示，若两国未在一个月内达成贸易协议，加拿大将进一步提高报复性关税。</p>

<p>Carney also said he's working on a new tariff rate.</p>
<p>卡尼称他正在制定新的关税税率。</p>
<p>Quote, and that means some foreign steel imports will still be allowed, but anything above that limit will be hit with a high tariff, making them more expensive.</p>
<p>这意味着部分外国钢铁进口仍被允许，但超出限额的将面临高额关税，导致成本上升。</p>
<p>And Carney said the goal here is to make Canadian steel more competitive.</p>
<p>卡尼表示此举旨在提升加拿大钢铁的竞争力。</p>

<p>And the BC New Democrats have now sent a letter to the RCMP.</p>
<p>BC新民主党已向皇家骑警致函。</p>
<p>They're asking the RCMP to investigate recent allegations made by BC Conservative Leader John Rustad.</p>

<p>We've been hearing calls from BC's human rights commissioner to uh push for an a human rightsbased approach to addressing the housing crisis.</p>

<p>Well um you know exactly that you mentioned that it was uh in 2019 that it was you know part of the national housing strategy you know and the province is responsible for a lot of that housing.</p>
<p>需省府跟进，这是集体努力。</p>

<p>Housing is a human right. And you know, this is on this is the top of everyone's minds.</p>
<p>90年代温哥华无家可归者极少，如今BC省近11000人，温哥华预计超4500人。</p>
<p>You know, um we heard it in in a bi-election. We heard it people talking about the downtown east side but also all across the city people are struggling and and I kept sort of saying this issue a lot this this kind of phrase a lot that is that homelessness is not natural you know this is a choice this is a policy choice and we've that we've got here you know you know it kind of seems like it's been around forever or it's just or it's this matter of you know you know individual responsibility but this is we made this happen in the '9s in Vancouver there wasn't a lot of homelessness.</p>

<p>And now as as you know, we're seeing the latest stats BC like almost 11,000 and in Vancouver, you know, we're expecting upwards of of 4 and a half thousand homeless.</p>
<p>这将建立法律框架，覆盖所有住房决策。</p>
<p>And so if you're if you're calling on the provincial government to step up um step up with what exactly what would that mean in practical terms?</p>
<p>为租户和无家可归者提供法律依据，防止流离失所或暂停支持性住房。</p>

<p>Well, I mean this would be a legal framework, right? So this wouldn't this would be a lens that covers every um decision on housing and this would this would give um tenants uh this would give uh homeless groups uh you know a standing a legal standing from which to argue their case or or you know to prevent you know any further displacement or or to sort of stop things like pausing supportive housing.</p>
<p>虽然温哥华可自主决定，但全省统一将避免此类问题。</p>
<p>Um that's a Vancouver decision though, right?</p>

<p>No, absolutely.

<p>住宅租赁委员会属省管辖，此举将增强租户安全性。</p>
<p>So, um we're we're moving in that direction and and that's great. So, but this this is tenants the res residential tenency board is provincial, so it would give tenants a lot more security.</p>

<p>you know, you know, housing around transit is great, but we don't want to see any displacement of of anyone in in nearby housing, you know, and this this puts things this takes pressure off of municipalities, too, right?</p>

<p>And I think a huge chunk of it comes down to uh the commodification of housing.</p>

<p>and right and so now we see uh Mark Carney's government talking about building more housing federally but when you look at uh declaring housing as a human right and sort of guaranteeing it for everyone how do you balance that against um market conditions that are dictating how much um homes cost or are sold for or or are rented for uh how do you balance housing as human right against uh market conditions that dictate how housing is is done right now</p>

<p>I think this is kind of now a common uh piece of knowledge.</p>

<p>So, what what are the practical steps do you think that need to be taken?</p>
<p>你认为需要采取哪些实际步骤？</p>
<p>Well, there's it's three pillars.</p>
<p>有三个支柱。</p>
<p>The two major factors is you have to produce a large amount of housing at a really high rate and you have to have the trades people to do it.</p>

<p>现在购房成本比收入高出60%。</p>
<p>So we're tagged to world economy and there's a lot of millionaires out there.</p>
<p>我们受全球经济影响，而且有很多百万富翁。</p>
<p>So these homes would be produced at a rate that's cheaper than practically anything else you can get on the open market and it should be given to individuals based on a form of contribution so that it's not monetary based because as soon as you put them open market and it becomes price function that we can't produce enough homes to make up for the demand.</p>
<p>这些住房将以比市场上任何其他选择更便宜的价格生产，并根据个人贡献分配，而不是基于金钱，因为一旦进入公开市场，价格机制会导致我们无法满足需求。</p>

<p>you know there was a lot you know there was a lot of things that were problematic uh there as well but you can't you can't just sweep people without providing the other option um you have to give them options and there's there's places you know you know in I think in Portland they have dignity village you know there's places that exper you know experimented with tiny home villages and we've been talking about that in Vancouver for a long time there is a pilot and um doesn't doesn't seem like it's going too well.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this for a long time and actually I have a lot of great a lot of great solutions for the problem.</p>
<p>我思考了很久，实际上有很多好的解决方案。</p>
<p>The the biggest thing first of all is that um I don't think in Canada we realize like there is a survival like a very basic survival triangle.</p>

<p>You need food, water, clothing, and shelter to survive.</p>
<p>生存需要食物、水、衣物和住所。</p>
<p>And the fact that that isn't a a human right first and foremost blows my mind.</p>
<p>这居然不是一项基本人权，让我震惊。</p>
<p>Secondly, like the fact that rent uh is used as a mechanism to provide shelter.</p>
<p>其次，租金作为提供住所的机制。</p>
<p>It it's it's it's fundamentally like the it's fundamentally uh like a bad idea because it's very uh susceptible to uh like the like the corrupting factor of like humans like which is to um basic make basically make it uh a profitable mechanism.</p>
<p>从根本上说，这是一个糟糕的主意，因为它很容易受到人类腐败因素的影响，最终将其变成一个盈利机制。</p>

<p>Okay. So um what we need to do first and foremost is limit the amount of property that can be rented.</p>
<p>首先，我们需要限制可出租房产的数量。</p>
<p>Um something like for example like like detached single family home.</p>
<p>例如，独立式单户住宅。</p>
<p>We wouldn't want any one person or organization owning more than say two properties personally because why do you need that much land if there's a limit if there's already a if it's already a finite resource why is a small sector of the population um able to basically hoard and gatekeep it from uh you know the larger population which needs it I guess they would say that they are providing some housing they're adding to um they're helping to fill that gap so Where should the the the rental units um come from then?</p>
<p>我们不希望任何个人或组织拥有超过两处房产，因为土地是有限资源，为什么一小部分人可以囤积并垄断它，而大多数人却需要它？他们可能会辩称自己在提供住房，填补缺口，那么租赁房源应该从哪里来呢？</p>

<p>So if there I agree with you that they are providing a service but the point the point is is that the service is being abused.</p>
<p>我同意他们在提供服务，但问题在于这种服务被滥用了。</p>
<p>There was a recent uh survey and study that came out that said that commercial companies are buying up and basically they they buy up as much of the product as they can and then they flip it and turn it into a rental property.</p>

<p>But they're buying up they're buying up entire swaps and entire neighborhoods and then artificially jacking up the price, keeping them vacant and and artificially uh manipulating the price to make rent as expensive and acceptable as as to maximize profits.</p>
<p>但他们正在收购整个街区和社区，然后人为抬高价格，保持空置，并通过操纵价格使租金尽可能高以最大化利润。</p>
<p>Kyle, I'm going to jump in. I'm sorry to do that because um it's just that uh you you I think you're referring to, you know, you're getting into the points around REITs and and real estate investment trusts.</p>

<p>Um the REITs are really the driving force in the catastrophe that is housing right now and housing is of course a human right.</p>

<p>And what happened was this hasn't been going on all along. The REITs only used to invest in commercial real estate.</p>
<p>这种情况并非一直存在。REITs过去只投资商业地产。</p>
<p>And in the late 90s and early 2000s, they came into residential real estate and nobody stopped them.</p>

<p>And there's now a class action lawsuit proposed to stop them from price fixing.</p>

<p>Yeah. So that's one that's a really really important point about the resevertising now for people to buy their stock right Jessica thank you so much I have uh just about under a minute here um councelor Sean or what should be done about REITs yeah uh that's it's a really good point I mean I think in BC we are a little bit uh more sheltered from REITs because we do have rent control um so when you take away that sort of financial incentive for for these you know, these tools to come in, you know, uh, and buy up a lot of housing.</p>
<p>是的，所以这是一个关于现在重新广告让人们购买股票的重要观点，杰西卡，非常感谢。我大约还有不到一分钟的时间，肖恩议员，关于房地产投资信托基金应该采取什么措施？这是一个非常好的观点。我认为在BC省，我们有点免受房地产投资信托基金的影响，因为我们有租金控制。所以当你消除了这些工具进入并大量购买住房的经济激励时，我们不会看到太多这种情况。</p>
<p>When you take away that incentive, we don't see it that much. In Ontario, it's it's it's pretty bad. Um, New York, uh, it was bad as well. But BC, it's kind we're kind of sheltered in a lot of ways, and that and that's because of those strong rental protections, and we can and we can go further with vacancy control.</p>
<p>当你消除了这种激励，我们不会看到太多这种情况。在安大略省，情况相当糟糕。纽约也是如此。但在BC省，我们在很多方面都受到保护，这是因为我们有强有力的租赁保护措施，我们还可以进一步实施空置控制。</p>

<p>Annabel Wright says, "We purchased a small condo in Victoria in the tourist area downtown so we could have a place to stay when visiting our family and his family, our son and his family. We now can't Airbnb it because of the legislation. And if you rent it out, we can't make our costs. If we tried to sell, we would lose money as the market is flooded. Uh, I don't think companies should hold multiple properties, but there must be a reasonable solution."</p>
<p>安娜贝尔·赖特说：“我们在维多利亚市中心旅游区购买了一套小公寓，以便在探望家人时有个住处。由于立法，我们现在无法通过爱彼迎出租。如果出租，我们无法收回成本。如果出售，我们会亏本，因为市场供过于求。我认为公司不应持有多个房产，但必须有一个合理的解决方案。”</p>
<p>Britney writes, "I recently bought a condo in Victoria and my impression is that people who bought 5 years ago during the pandemic are asking for too much. During the pandemic, the market peaked and now folks who want to sell their investments are asking too much. It's not the whole story, but it is a piece of the puzzle."</p>

<p>I'm pleased to welcome my guests now, Raymond Jordan Brown. They are a two-spirit multi-hyphenate artist who's worked with indigenous youth at Foundry BC and the Canadian Mental Health Association. Raymond, thanks for joining us and uh happy upcoming National Indigenous People's Day. Yes, thank you so much. As we say in Migma Walin, which means thank you for having me and on this important holiday. It's my pleasure. you know, I've seen your photos um on various on on Instagram, on various things and I can feel the joy just bursting off the screen. Um you really do have that um you are celebrating through your photos and your art, you know. Tell me a bit about how you are marking National Indigenous People's Day.</p>
<p>我很高兴欢迎我的嘉宾雷蒙德·乔丹·布朗。他是一位双灵多才多艺的艺术家，曾在Foundry BC和加拿大心理健康协会与原住民青年合作。雷蒙德，感谢你的加入，预祝全国原住民日快乐。是的，非常感谢。正如我们用米格玛瓦林语说的，意思是感谢你们邀请我参加这个重要的节日。这是我的荣幸。你知道，我在Instagram上看到过你的照片，我能感受到屏幕中溢出的喜悦。你真的通过照片和艺术在庆祝。请告诉我你如何庆祝全国原住民日。</p>
<p>Yeah, this year I actually have the privilege and opportunity to be in York uh celebrating Pride with uh one of my best friends, Shalazison Laroo, who uh a lot of indigenous folks know her as Auntie on Tik Tok. So, we're really excited to I think spend time in community, be together, and enjoy the land and and bring that indigenous resurgence into the stage and into the live entertainment that's there. Wow. Tell me more about that indigenous resurgence. Um you know, Yes. leaning into that. Yeah. Yeah. So, indigenous resurgence I I took me a while to reconcile with this word reconciliation. What is my role in reconciliation and is it my role? And so, uh Leon Simpson is a wonderful Anesnab author who talks about indigenous resurgence. It's this idea of restoring what was rather than looking at where we're at, looking at where we were before, where there was this respect and reciprocity that was innate in our relationships with all living beings. And so bringing that back to the forefront and seeing how everyone benefits from that transformational relationship and and shifting how we we exist and live alongside each other.</p>
<p>今年我有幸有机会在约克与我的好朋友莎拉齐森·拉鲁一起庆祝骄傲月，很多原住民在TikTok上称她为阿姨。我们非常兴奋能在社区中度过时光，聚在一起，享受这片土地，并将原住民的复兴带到舞台和现场娱乐中。哇。请多谈谈原住民复兴。是的，深入探讨这一点。原住民复兴，我花了一些时间与“和解”这个词和解。我在和解中的角色是什么？这是我的角色吗？利昂·辛普森是一位出色的阿尼什纳比作家，他谈到了原住民复兴。这是一种恢复过去的理念，而不是看我们现在的位置，而是看我们过去的位置，那时我们与所有生命的关系中有着内在的尊重和互惠。将这一点重新置于前沿，看看每个人如何从这种变革性关系中受益，并改变我们共存和共同生活的方式。</p>

<p>Wow. Where do you think we can see that now or where can we bring that into you know how we live our lives? Yeah. I think I mean there's this old school uh elder he said you know sometimes your meditation as you're walking down the street you know when you look at the trees the things that you breathe out are what the trees need and what the trees release are what you need and just that conscious awareness as you're walking down the street um you know going through downtown Vancouver I'm kind of the person who loves talking to strangers I don't get that at all but but I've learned so much I've been able to express different parts of elves and learn so many different lessons. So, I think taking it down to the micro relationships between us and all living things, you know, saying hi to your neighbor, um checking in with people, uh the coffee I have right here from the coffee shop outside, you know, we had a great conversation uh before we even started this interview. So, how do you take advantage of these moments that we don't even think about anymore?</p>
<p>哇。你认为我们现在在哪里可以看到这一点，或者我们可以如何将其融入我们的生活中？是的，我想有一位老派的长者说过，有时你在街上行走时的冥想，当你看着树木时，你呼出的东西是树木需要的，而树木释放的东西是你需要的。在温哥华市中心行走时，我就是那种喜欢与陌生人交谈的人，虽然并不总是如此，但我学到了很多，能够表达不同的自我部分，并学到了许多不同的教训。所以，我认为将其落实到我们与所有生命之间的微观关系中，比如向邻居问好，与人交流，比如我手边的这杯咖啡，来自外面的咖啡店，我们在开始这次采访之前就有过很好的交谈。如何利用这些我们甚至不再思考的时刻？</p>
<p>I love that the reciprocity.</p>
<p>我喜欢这种互惠关系。</p>

<p>Yeah, it's so brilliant.

<p>是的，它太棒了，非常有趣。有时当我们想到原住民时，我们倾向于用宽泛的笔触来定义，但你知道，仅在不列颠哥伦比亚省就有超过200个原住民社区，每个社区都有自己的故事、语言和存在方式，因此在这个空间中突出并带入主流是绝对出色和有趣的。</p>

<p>我认为阿洛，一位喜剧演员和公开演讲者，非二元性别者，他经常谈论快乐是被社会压迫时经常被剥夺的东西，当你找到快乐时，那真的是一种抵抗行为，我认为这是唯一的前进道路，当我们看到当今世界的复杂性和许多不同群体的解放斗争时，我们常常忘记了快乐。</p>
