<p>詹妮弗·格里芬正在五角大楼进行直播。</p>
<p>Uh let's bring Jennifer in.</p>
<p>请接通詹妮弗。</p>
<p>Jennifer, we're just getting word obviously with the president's um announcement what this looks like.</p>

<p>Well, Brett, we knew that there was something a foot this morning when we woke and heard that there were six B2 bombers that had been seen leaving Whiteitman Air Force Base uh last last night at midnight.</p>
<p>布雷特，今早我们察觉异常，因为有六架B2轰炸机昨夜午夜从怀特曼空军基地起飞。</p>
<p>Um and so those planes, we were told, were heading towards Guam.</p>
<p>据悉这些飞机正飞往关岛。</p>

<p>Now, Guam would have been an 18-hour flight into Iran.</p>
<p>关岛至伊朗需18小时航程。</p>
<p>So, it is likely that it was a different set of B2 bombers that were used to bomb the sites, the three sites that the president mentioned tonight on Truth Social.</p>
<p>因此实际执行轰炸的可能是另一批B2，打击了总统在Truth Social上提及的三处目标。</p>
<p>That is the Fordo complex, which we've been watching all week.</p>
<p>即福特核设施（我们持续监控一周）。</p>

<p>That is the massive main sort of what's known as the the uh the heart or the crown jewel of Iran's nuclear program.</p>
<p>它是伊朗核项目的核心所在。</p>
<p>It's underneath that mountain u just outside of Comb, which is two hours south of Thrron.</p>
<p>该设施位于库姆城外山体深处（库姆在德黑兰以南两小时车程）。</p>
<p>That complex we understand has been bombed by those U USB B2 bombers.</p>
<p>据悉该设施今晚遭美军B2轰炸。</p>

<p>Tonight also Isvahan as well as Natans.</p>
<p>今晚同时打击了伊斯法罕及纳坦兹。</p>
<p>Natans had another underground facility.</p>
<p>纳坦兹拥有另一处地下设施。</p>
<p>Remember before Faro was built in 2006.</p>
<p>需知2006年福特建成前。</p>
<p>Natans had been the main uh enrichment site.</p>
<p>纳坦兹曾是主要浓缩铀基地。</p>
<p>Uh it was also built underground.</p>
<p>该设施同样建于地下。</p>
<p>Israeli jets had been targeting it in the last uh in the last week but they had not been able to penetrate underground.</p>
<p>近期遭以色列战机攻击但未被穿透。</p>

<p>So those USB B2 bombers uh which flew out of Whiteitman uh Air Force Base in Missouri, they uh would have taken out that underground facility.</p>
<p>此次从密苏里州怀特曼基地起飞的B2可能摧毁了该设施。</p>
<p>Natans is interesting.</p>
<p>纳坦兹值得注意。</p>
<p>You'll remember Brett, it was the site of the Stuckset virus, the cyber attack on those centrifuges uh years ago.</p>
<p>布雷特，这里曾是"震网"病毒攻击离心机的场所。</p>

<p>Uh but again, it was back up and running.</p>
<p>但后来恢复运作。</p>
<p>And um what is surprising I think tonight is that the president announced that it was not one site but three underground sites and and and uh sites uh inside Iran's nuclear program that were struck by the US Air Force tonight.</p>
<p>令人意外的是，总统宣布今晚美军同时打击了三处核设施。</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>And it is something we'll go back to that truth social and eventually uh control room if we can put it up there just so that everybody can see it on the screen.</p>
<p>我们将回放Truth Social声明以便观众查看。</p>
<p>uh the fact that this first of all this announcement comes from truth social.</p>
<p>首先，声明通过Truth Social发布。</p>
<p>Um this is a president who has put out a lot of announcements uh big announcements through uh Truth Social.</p>
<p>这位总统常通过该平台发布重大声明。</p>

<p>Uh and this is the biggest of them probably his biggest decision.</p>
<p>此次可能是其最重大的决策。</p>
<p>Um the completed the very successful attack on three nuclear sites as you said uh Fordo, Natans and Esfahan getting very specific there and the payload he says a full payload of bombs dropped on the primary site for that suggests Jennifer as we had been saying for many days that they may have made several passes at Fordo considering that um the experts were saying that just one probably wouldn't wouldn't have gotten to the heart of that facility.</p>
<p>他特别强调"满载炸弹"攻击主要目标，暗示福特设施可能遭多次轰炸，因专家认为单次打击难以摧毁核心。</p>

<p>Well, remember Brett, we've been reporting in recent days that Fordo is interesting because it has two entrance points and we were told by experts who had have followed the planning for this kind of strike for a long time that it would take uh at least two bombs from the B2s u those mops, the massive ordinance penetrators, those are 30,000lb bombs and each B2 can carry two of them.</p>
<p>福特拥有两个入口，需至少两枚B2搭载的3万磅巨型钻地弹（MOP）。</p>
<p>Usually the way it works is that one of the mop uh uh 30,000 pound bunker buster is dropped.</p>
<p>通常首枚炸弹先发射。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>It goes into a hole that's about a radius of about 25 ft, I'm told.</p>
<p>据信会形成25英尺半径的孔洞。</p>
<p>And then uh the second bomb is dropped in the same hole.</p>
<p>次枚沿同一通道打击。</p>
<p>And so at first that 30,000lb bunker buster will go down about 200 f feet, explode, and then make way for the second bomb which falls into that exact uh 25 ft uh radius hole.</p>
<p>首枚深入200英尺爆炸后，次枚沿同一通道实施打击。</p>

<p>And of course, people are calling right now, so just a moment.</p>
<p>目前有来电接入，请稍候。</p>
<p>Um uh and so what's interesting about it, Brett, is that you would have had to have at least two B2s, but I believe that it was likely a package of six B2s that would be flying.</p>
<p>据信此次出动了六架B2。</p>
<p>They each had two mop u massive warnips penetrators on board at the time and um and they would have hit both those entrances at Ford.</p>
<p>每架携带两枚MOP，同时攻击两个入口。</p>

<p>The president saying that that fore u that the complete package was struck.</p>
<p>总统称"完全摧毁"。</p>
<p>Um that is significant because that means as you said that it would probably be multiple passes and multiple bombs dropped there.</p>
<p>这表明实施了多轮轰炸。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>So as we get ready remember they are let's see 7 hours ahead.</p>
<p>伊朗当地时间比美国早7小时。</p>

<p>Um and this would have been the window uh to pull this off.</p>
<p>当前正是行动窗口。</p>
<p>Uh the president again saying that it was very successful in three different sites.</p>
<p>总统重申三处目标均被成功摧毁。</p>
<p>Uh we should point out that the Israelis have worked really as we've been reporting over the last week plus uh very hard to take out the air defenses of Iran already in uh a first wave of runs back in October.</p>
<p>以色列此前已削弱伊朗防空系统：10月首波空袭清除大量地对空导弹。</p>

<p>Uh the Israeli military and air force took out a lot of those surfaceto-air missiles.</p>
<p>以军清除了大量地对空导弹。</p>
<p>Uh now with this latest uh bombing run uh over the past few days, Jennifer, they have essentially eliminated it and and to talk to Israeli officials, they said they have control of the skies, really a a full uh path to Tyrron and they've been taking out sites and targets um at the at their will, they suggested u and this led the way for this bombing run tonight.</p>
<p>近期轰炸更彻底夺取制空权，为今晚行动铺路。</p>

<p>Well, the Israeli Air Force has just been unbelievable in terms of their success since June 12th.</p>
<p>以军自6月12日起战果惊人。</p>
<p>They have been carrying out non-stop runs and and strikes against uh Iranian targets, including the first night 14 Iranian nuclear scientists who were taken off the battlefield, as well as about 50 top generals in the Iranian military, including the the head of uh their air force, their ballistic missiles, their drone capabilities, their IRGC, the Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>
<p>包括首夜清除14名核科学家及50名高级将领（含空军、弹道导弹、无人机及革命卫队指挥官）。</p>

<p>So, they have really um had incredible success in terms of um all of the spots and all of the above ground spots that an F-16 or an F-35 uh could could uh take out.</p>
<p>清除了F-16/F-35可打击的所有地面目标。</p>
<p>They said a few days ago that they had air superiority.</p>
<p>几天前以军宣布掌握空中优势。</p>
<p>That then opens the way for the um and what that means is that they've taken out most of the air defense systems on the ground so that then uh their planes could really fly with impunity.</p>
<p>这意味着地面防空系统基本瘫痪，战机可长驱直入。</p>

<p>And that also opened the way for those very very uh um you know the stealth uh bombers the B2 bombers which also are escorted we're told by F-22s and F-16s and also the EA18 Growlers.</p>
<p>这为B2隐形轰炸机（由F-22/F-16及EA-18G护航）创造了条件。</p>
<p>They play a very significant role.</p>
<p>后者发挥关键作用。</p>

<p>And remember that second aircraft carrier, the USS Nimmits, had just gotten into the region uh earlier today.</p>

<p>Those EA18 Growlers are on board those aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>两舰均搭载EA-18G。</p>
<p>There are absolutely essential uh for the B2 to fly over Iran even though the Israelis had air superiority over the country.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Jen, um we have seen a lot of Israeli missiles and drones coming in really night after night into Israel.</p>
<p>值得注意的是，以色列近期持续遭遇导弹/无人机袭击。</p>
<p>Um this night has not seen that much of of that.</p>
<p>但今晚袭击显著减少。</p>
<p>There have been a few warnings, but not not the same volley that we've heard in recent days.</p>
<p>仅有零星警报，不如此前密集。</p>

<p>In addition to taking out the surface air missiles and clearing the way uh for the ability to take out targets inside Iran, um they've also really managed to take out a lot of missile sites and uh places that have been threats for missiles fired from Iran.</p>
<p>以军还摧毁了大量导弹发射场。</p>
<p>There is a sense uh even that they were taking out the trucks that moved the missiles.</p>
<p>甚至包括导弹运输车。</p>

<p>uh as precise as the Israeli military uh targeting has been.</p>
<p>以军打击极其精准。</p>
<p>You've been reporting on that over the last few days.</p>
<p>您近日持续报道此事。</p>
<p>It's really extraordinary because when this started Yes.</p>
<p>战果惊人——冲突初期。</p>
<p>when this started uh the Israelis uh estimated that the Iranians had about 100 mobile uh ballistic missile launchers.</p>
<p>伊朗约有100辆机动导弹发射车。</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV141NDzpEXw/?t=536" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:08:56</span></a></h3>
<p>They have taken out, they think, about 55% of any of the missile launchers that the Iranians have access to.</p>
<p>目前约55%已被摧毁。</p>
<p>Now, the Iranians have blown through quite a few quite a bit of their uh their uh missile stockpile.</p>
<p>伊朗已消耗大量导弹库存。</p>
<p>They had about I think uh about 3,000 ballistic missiles when this started, maybe between 1,000 to 2,000 that could reach Israel, and I think that they've fired about 500.</p>
<p>初期拥有约3000枚弹道导弹（其中1000-2000枚可打击以色列），已发射约500枚。</p>

<p>Uh but most importantly, the IDF and the Israeli Air Force have have been able to take out, as you mentioned, uh almost half of the missile launchers.</p>
<p>最重要的是，以军摧毁了近半数发射车。</p>
<p>So each night, we've seen fewer and fewer ballistic missiles uh being fired at Israel.</p>
<p>因此每晚袭以导弹逐渐减少。</p>
<p>All of the drones that have been fired at Israel have been taken out.</p>
<p>所有无人机均被拦截。</p>

<p>We understand that Israeli pilots along with American uh fighter pilots have been taking down those drones each night.</p>
<p>以美飞行员每晚执行拦截任务。</p>
<p>Um, so American pilots have been helping as well as along with those US Navy destroyers.</p>
<p>美军也深度参与——5艘东地中海驱逐舰。</p>
<p>There are five US Navy destroyers in the eastern Med off the coast of Israel who've been using their Eegis uh defense systems to uh shoot down ballistic missiles over Israel.</p>
<p>用"宙斯盾"系统拦截导弹。</p>

<p>So the US has been very involved along with US soldiers who are on the ground.</p>
<p>300名美军士兵。</p>
<p>There are about 300 US soldiers uh that are working at um who are manning the the THAAD and the Patriot pack three missiles that are defending cities within Israel and those are operated by US soldiers about 100 soldiers per per THAD missile.</p>
<p>操作以色列境内的"萨德"及"爱国者"反导系统（每套"萨德"配置100人）。</p>
