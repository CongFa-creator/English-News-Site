<li><a href="#block-2">00:00:11 This is the best time ever in the history of technology ever</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-3">00:00:32 Um maybe we just start with that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-4">00:00:49 Um AGI sounded crazy.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-5">00:01:27 Uh, and those are like very important moments and I think wh</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-6">00:01:43 It's so hard to remember what it was like.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-7">00:02:03 We were trying to like play video games and we had this litt</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-8">00:02:21 It it was such it's it's like hard to explain now because it</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-9">00:02:49 That second part was sort of easier than it sounds.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-10">00:03:06 99% of the world thought we were crazy.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-11">00:03:20 So even though it seemed unlikely, if it worked, it it seeme</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-12">00:03:35 And if you're doing like a oneofone thing, uh you you have a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-13">00:03:53 You know, were there lessons from that?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-14">00:04:08 Um so the the things that eventually become really big do no</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-15">00:04:32 They're both like a few people sitting in a room and you're </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-16">00:04:49 But other than that, it's like one dumb foot in front of the</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:05:06 I think we're in a really interesting time.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:05:23 There's a huge even if the models got no better which of cou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:05:42 Um we have an open source model coming out soon.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:06:05 Um but so you have this world where like the model capabilit</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:06:38 So only in the last month I think have we really started to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:06:56 Yeah me memory is my favorite feature that we've launched th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:07:17 It'll it won't just be like you send a message and it sends </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:07:33 I think memory is the first time where people can sort of se</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:07:47 No, no.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:08:02 Um, but I think the key of her is not the little piece of ha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:08:17 Uh, you know, I've heard rumors that MCP is coming to OpenAI</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:08:29 What has been surprising about the actual integrations?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:08:48 Um and integrating into as many data sources as possible is </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:09:03 Do you think that'll be in the cloud in the future, or will </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:09:19 like our cloud.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:09:33 I mean, we've gotten really good at it, but it is we we went</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:09:53 And I think doing that is just hard no matter what.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:10:11 Um, we're seeing reasoning models like 03 and 04 mini uh evo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:10:36 If you ask a question, you could imagine it thinking super h</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:10:54 that AI sort of somewhat already does, but when we get to a </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:11:12 You know, that's having vision, having speech, and having re</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:11:30 Um I think I am very excited about a world where when you si</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:11:46 I think we're not that far away now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:12:05 making a billion robots is still going to take a while but I</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:12:42 Um sitting here where we are geopolitically, you know, what </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:13:00 There are all of these answers that people throw around and </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:13:15 And you know, like AI and robotics does give us a new possib</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:13:33 You know, one of the classic questions is, you know, how do </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:13:51 We are going to try to make the best super assistant out of </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:14:25 Um, we would like to make it easier for you all.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:14:42 You could imagine that we could do like a signin with OpenAI</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:14:55 Our advice is like don't build our core you know chat assist</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:15:14 And so rather than go build the thing that you have thought </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:15:37 and and the I there is hopefully in this room um the person </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:15:55 Sometimes it works.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:16:10 It took us a long time to figure out how to answer the defen</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:16:30 But you know that was like a fair criticism of us for a long</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:16:55 Um I think that you've Peter is a genius.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:17:34 It is hard to have conviction in the face of a lot of other </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:17:57 we've been working together for a while and said we had a ze</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:18:07 Doesn't make sense."</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:18:19 And you have these people who are smart and that you look up</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:18:35 And I don't have a magic answer other than it's really tough</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:18:52 you know, that's uh sort of level three AGI.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:19:12 For a long time, chatb was like a Google replacement.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:19:28 But now you start to see things where you can like really gi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:19:45 And if you think about how much of the work that the world d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:20:12 How do you see the future of human computer interaction and </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:20:31 Like voice interfaces today we think of as something that is</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:20:48 I don't want to think about it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:21:01 When I like use my phone today, I feel like I am like walkin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:21:17 It's just stressful.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:21:35 Uh, and I'm I'm quite excited for that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:21:51 Is that one of the reasons why you brought on one of the gre</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:22:09 So we had the you know keyboard and mouse and screen and the</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:22:28 So one of the things that uh we've been debating at YC that </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:22:59 You're just going to go in and it'll code gen an artifact or</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:23:15 Uh first of all, assume you all are like starting startups o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:23:39 So on one hand you can look at something like that and say w</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:24:16 So you can look at this all of these problems one way or ano</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:24:37 Act on it from that direction.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:24:51 I think the question behind the question is like, "What are </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:25:08 And uh I was just thinking about that like I never would hav</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:25:23 I guess we're entering this age of intelligence.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:25:50 Um, and we we have this more impressive tool chain.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:26:19 But what someone can do now with this new set of tools, with</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:26:44 And that is a bigger deal than it sounds like u because coor</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:27:03 So I think the the amount that one person or small team get </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:27:25 But I try to remember that I always also have to think about</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:27:49 I mean, this room is you're preaching to the room of the con</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:28:04 This is this is very cool to see.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:28:27 You know, what what do you have to say to the 3,000 people i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:28:50 Um, and that's just like a fun way to live your life and you</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:29:28 So, you're sort of one of the best people in the world at um</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:29:52 hiring really smart people who are clearly really driven and</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:30:40 I mean by uh strong track record do you mean the person who'</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:31:02 There experience is valuable and there are times where you y</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:31:33 There will come a time where you need some of those people l</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:31:44 I would always go right to like what's the most impressive s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:32:04 I see PB back there.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:32:20 I don't recommend it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:32:44 Looking ahead 10 to 20 years, what are you sort of most pers</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:33:06 Look, there there's a lot um you know, in 10 or 20 years, un</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:33:26 I I am a believer that to a first order approximation all lo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:33:56 So I think I'd pick that on that time frame.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:34:12 Um, was that something that you were thinking about even all</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:34:37 and and really like the two areas that I I knew I wanted to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-104">00:34:57 And I don't know how I missed that because I usually am good</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-105">00:35:08 And I obviously right after starting open AI, I got obsessed</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:35:30 I've been obsessed with that chart a long time.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:35:49 So that was that chart and charts like that were a significa</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:36:06 I had like the one interest of like radical abundance and ju</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:36:20 Now I think a lot about like how much energy can we actually</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:36:34 I mean it seems like one of the uh defining beliefs that tec</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:36:51 It's like, you know, all uh all watched over by machines of </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-112">00:37:06 Totally.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:37:21 Um, and I think it is like it it is one of the movements tha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:37:51 How do we get there though, right?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:38:06 You know does government play a role in this?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:38:32 Um five more years I think we'll be able to maintain the sam</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:38:50 The the analogy I like most for AI is the transistor like th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:39:06 The magic of that just figured out how to make incredible va</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-119">00:39:21 You know, we need to make the great technology, figure out t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-120">00:39:37 So, let's uh flash back to 2005.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-121">00:40:05 And then um I think Paul said, "Oh, you're a freshman. You k</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-122">00:40:22 I'm curious.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-123">00:40:38 So I in some ways you know the wild thing is you're sitting </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-124">00:41:09 I wish someone had like taught me the importance of like con</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-125">00:41:28 Um, also just sort of like trust that it's eventually going </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-126">00:41:52 Developing like trust in your own instincts and increasing t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-127">00:42:06 Uh, I think that's really important.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-128">00:42:18 Um the hard parts are much harder.</a></li>

<p>This is the best time ever in the history of technology ever, period, to start a company.</p>
<p>这绝对是科技史上创业的最佳时机。</p>
<p>[Music] Well, Sam, thank you so much for joining us and thanks for all the inspiration.</p>
<p>[音乐] 山姆，非常感谢你的分享和带来的启发。</p>
<p>I mean, OpenAI itself uh is a true inspiration for any really really ambitious person.</p>

<p>Um maybe we just start with that.</p>
<p>或许我们可以从这里开始聊起。</p>
<p>I mean, what were some of the decisions early that seemed small that turned out to be incredibly pivotal?</p>
<p>早期有哪些看似微小却被证明至关重要的决策？</p>
<p>I mean, just deciding to do it was a big one.</p>
<p>光是决定做这件事就是个重大抉择。</p>
<p>Like there we got very close to not starting OpenAI.</p>
<p>我们当时差点就没创立OpenAI。</p>

<p>Um AGI sounded crazy.</p>
<p>通用人工智能听起来很荒谬。</p>
<p>I was I had Gary's job then and we were you know there was like all this other great stuff to do that would work all these great startups and AGI was like kind of a pipe dream and also even if it was possible deep mind seemed like impossibly far ahead and so we had this year over the course of 2015 where we were talking about starting it and you know it was like kind of coin flippy um and I think this is the the story of like many ambitious things where they seem so difficult and there's such good reasons not to do them that really takes a core of people that like sit in a room, look each other in the eye and say, "All right, let's do this."</p>
<p>我当时担任Gary的职位，明明可以投资其他靠谱的初创公司，而AGI就像天方夜谭，即便可能实现，DeepMind也遥遥领先。2015年我们反复讨论是否要创立，这就像抛硬币决定。所有雄心勃勃的事业都是如此——看似困难重重且有充分理由放弃，最终需要一群人围坐桌前，彼此凝视说"好，我们干吧"。</p>

<p>Uh, and those are like very important moments and I think when in doubt, you should lean into them.</p>
<p>这些关键时刻至关重要，犹豫时更应该勇往直前。</p>
<p>So, there were just a billion things, a billion reasons why people might say you shouldn't do it.</p>
<p>当时有无数个理由让人放弃。</p>
<p>I mean, off the bat, like even you one of the things you figured out was the scaling laws.</p>

<p>It's so hard to remember what it was like.</p>
<p>现在很难回想当时的情景。</p>

<p>明年就是我们十周年了。</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>谢谢。</p>
<p>But to to like remember what the vibes were like about AI 10 years ago, that was like way before the first language models that worked.</p>

<p>We were trying to like play video games and we had this little robotic hand that could sort of barely do a Rubik's cube and we had no ideas for products, no revenue, no really idea that we were ever going to have revenue.</p>
<p>我们当时尝试用AI玩电子游戏，有个勉强能解魔方的机械手，没有产品构想、没有收入，甚至不确定未来能否盈利。</p>
<p>And we were like sitting around at conference tables and whiteboards trying to come up with ideas for papers to write.</p>

<p>It it was such it's it's like hard to explain now because it looks so obvious now how improbable it seemed at the time and how the idea of chatbt was like completely in the realm of science fiction.</p>
<p>如今看来难以置信——当时ChatGPT的概念完全属于科幻范畴，现在却如此理所当然。</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things that really jumped out at me was uh you sort of, you know, rallied this idea that you should be working on AGI and then simultaneously you found the smartest people in the world who were working on that thing.</p>

<p>GPT5不会完全实现，但最终我们需要能按需推理、实时生成视频的统一模型。</p>

<p>提问时，它会深度思考、研究、编码生成专属应用，或渲染可交互的实时视频。</p>

<p>making a billion robots is still going to take a while but I don't know I'm interested in the question of how many robots do you need to fully automate the supply chain like if you make a million humanoid robots the oldfashioned way can they run the entire supply chain drive the mining equipment like drive the container ships run the you know foundaries and make the new robots and then maybe like you actually can get a lot of robots in the world quickly but the demand for human robots in the world will be far more than we know how to think about with the current supply chain.</p>
<p>量产十亿机器人仍需时间，但更值得思考的是：百万传统人形机器人能否自动化整个供应链——从采矿设备到集装箱船再到铸造新机器人？当前供应链体系可能无法满足未来对人形机器人的爆炸性需求。</p>

<p>And if you think about how much of the work that the world does is work that can be done in front of a computer in like few hour chunks where you then have someone say like okay that was good enough or not.</p>
<p>想想多少工作可通过电脑在几小时内完成并等待审核。</p>
<p>It's quite a lot.</p>
<p>数量庞大。</p>
<p>So I I think this is going to go this is part of that overhang we were talking about earlier but I think this is going to go quite far and I think with current 03 to say nothing of our next model you can build a lot of experiences like this.</p>

<p>So we had the you know keyboard and mouse and screen and then we had touch and phones and the opportunity to do a new one doesn't come along that often and I think AI really does totally open the playing field for something completely new and I think if you got to pick one person to bet on to figure that out he is the obvious bet.</p>

<p>So one of the things that uh we've been debating at YC that you know don't know if this is good might be scary for a lot of software engineers who want to create B2B SAS is this idea that uh what if in the future you had your you know underlying database you have an API layer that is uh you know your access control and enforces your business logic and then the interface is the LLM like your computer is literally you know the agent and uh you have just in time software.</p>
<p>在YC我们讨论未来B2B SaaS可能形态：底层数据库+业务逻辑API层+LLM交互界面，实现即时软件生成。</p>

<p>You're just going to go in and it'll code gen an artifact or, you know, a pain for you that like does that thing you wanted and it'll go in the file and it'll bring it back if you ever need it.</p>
<p>你只需输入需求，它就会生成一个代码产物，或解决你所需的痛点，存入文件并随时调用。</p>
<p>That's going to happen.</p>
<p>这必将成为现实。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>没错。</p>
<p>Look here here there are two ways you can look at this.</p>
<p>注意，这个问题可以从两个角度看待。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>Uh first of all, assume you all are like starting startups or have started startups, think about starting startups.</p>
<p>首先，假设你们正在或考虑创业。</p>
<p>This is the best time ever in the history of technology ever, period, to start a company.</p>
<p>此刻是科技史上创业的最佳时机，没有之一。</p>
<p>Um yeah, this is uh and but part of the reason it's the best is because like the ground is shaking and it's true there are a lot of these challenges.</p>
<p>当然，部分原因在于技术地基正在震动，挑战固然存在。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>So on one hand you can look at something like that and say we have been a you know SAS company and now like all of the code can just be generated right in time when someone needs it and what does that mean for us or you can look at it and say wow this is going to happen but it's going to happen to everybody and the way startups win is when they can iterate faster than big companies and they can do it at a much lower cost.</p>
<p>一方面，SaaS公司可能担忧即时代码生成的冲击；另一方面，这种现象将普遍发生，而初创企业的胜出关键在于以更低成本实现更快迭代。</p>
<p>like big companies have a lot of advantages but they iterate very slowly um and they you know if something is like very cheap then a lot of their big advantages go away.</p>
<p>大公司虽有优势但迭代迟缓，当成本骤降时，其优势便大幅削弱。</p>

<p>So you can look at this all of these problems one way or another.</p>
<p>因此这些问题可多角度解读。</p>
<p>But the way I would recommend looking at them is everybody is going to face the same challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>但我建议的视角是：所有人将面临相同的挑战与机遇。</p>
<p>But when the clock cycle of the industry changes this much startups almost always win and we've probably never seen it change this much.</p>

<p>Uh you know, backstage at one of the last events we had uh you know, we were talking about the this there's this book that's sort of like the classic Mckenzie, which is the seven powers.</p>

<p>And that is a bigger deal than it sounds like u because coordination costs are are huge.</p>
<p>这比听来更重要，因为协作成本极高。</p>
<p>And when we can empower people with more knowledge, more tools, more resources, whatever, I think we won't just see like a little bit more stuff get built, but because of these kind of coordination costs across people, we'll see like a real stuff change.</p>

<p>你堪称最擅长聚集顶尖人才的人之一。</p>
<p>Um what are some of the hardest lessons you've had to learn about hiring?</p>
<p>关于招聘，你学到的最艰难经验是什么？</p>
<p>A lot of the people in this room like they have never managed a person before, let alone gotten someone to quit their, you know, six to seven figure job at some big company to come work on their revolution.</p>
<p>在场许多人未曾管理他人，更别说说服高薪人士加入创业革命。</p>

<p>hiring really smart people who are clearly really driven and really productive and can work as part of a team I think does get you 90% of the way there and the degree to which people focus on other things to hire for always surprises me.</p>
<p>招聘聪明、自驱、高效且具团队精神的人已解决90%问题，但人们总过度关注其他特质。</p>
<p>So I think you know given that we can't do the full 45 minutes right now really smart people driven curious self-motivated hardworking uh like good track record of accomplishment and can work really well as part of a team and sort of aligned with the company's vision and so everybody's at least going for the same the same direction that works pretty well.</p>
<p>简言之：聪明、自驱、好奇、勤奋、有成就记录、团队协作且认同公司愿景——这些特质组合效果极佳。</p>

<p>The magic of that just figured out how to make incredible value for people and really over a fairly short period of decades significantly ramp up quality of life.</p>
<p>这种魔力在短短几十年间就显著提升了生活质量。</p>
<p>I think this will be even faster and steeper than that.</p>

<p>You know, we need to make the great technology, figure out the remaining scientific stuff, which I don't think there's much left.</p>
<p>我们需要完善技术，解决剩余的科学问题——虽然所剩无几。</p>
<p>We need to figure out how to build out the infrastructure that you all will need to be able to service and then you all have got to go figure out what what people in the world need um with this new magic.</p>
<p>还要建设你们所需的服务基础设施，然后由你们来探索如何用这项新魔法满足世界需求。</p>

<p>So, let's uh flash back to 2005.</p>
<p>让我们闪回2005年。</p>
<p>Uh the very first batch of Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Y Combinator的首期项目。</p>
<p>Um, how did you hear about Paul Graham?</p>
<p>你是怎么知道保罗·格雷厄姆的？</p>
<p>You were reading his essays.</p>
<p>你在读他的文章。</p>
<p>I was reading his essays.</p>
<p>是的，我在读他的文章。</p>
<p>So, I'd heard about like he kind of had this cult following on the internet, but I heard about uh what was then called the summer founders program and now it's just called Y Cominator from Blake Ross who I lived in the same freshman dorm with and posted about it on Facebook.</p>
<p>他在网上有一批狂热追随者，但我是从同住新生宿舍的布莱克·罗斯那里听说"夏季创始人计划"（现称YC）的，他在Facebook上发了帖子。</p>

<p>And then um I think Paul said, "Oh, you're a freshman. You know that there's like another batch coming."</p>
<p>然后保罗说："哦，你是新生。知道下期项目吗？"</p>
<p>And what did you reply to him by email with?</p>
<p>你邮件里怎么回复的？</p>
<p>You know, funny you bring that up.</p>
<p>说来有趣。</p>
<p>I just dug up the email like a couple of days ago because I I felt I had been misqued over time.</p>
<p>我前几天刚翻出那封邮件，因为觉得长期被误引。</p>

<p>It was like oh maybe there was some misunderstanding.</p>
<p>写着"可能有误会，其实我是大二生，仍想参加下期"。</p>

<p>创业也是如此——美好超乎想象，艰难难以言表，唯有坚持。</p>
