<li><a href="#block-4">00:01:11 Before diving to speed, a lot of people ask me, hey Andrew, </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-5">00:01:52 So for whatever reason, media and social media tends not to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-6">00:02:17 And about a year and a half ago, when I started to go around</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-7">00:02:51 And the way we have an LOM output something is as if you're </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-8">00:03:18 With a gentigrap, those, we can go to AI system and ask it t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-9">00:03:58 We found that these agentic workflows are really a huge diff</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-10">00:04:43 With a bias or focus on the application layer, let me now di</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-11">00:05:14 It's too vague.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-12">00:05:35 That's actually business already doing this, but it is concr</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-13">00:05:52 But if someone says, could you build an app, Gmail integrate</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-14">00:06:10 If you go and tell all your friends, we should use AI to opt</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-15">00:06:27 We can discover that much more fast, which is what's importa</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-16">00:06:48 So let's do that quickly.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:07:11 And then after that long process, I think YC sometimes calls</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:07:36 It can be surprisingly good mechanism for making decisions.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:07:57 And then one other thing, but many successful starters, at a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:08:18 Just pivot on the dime to pursue a totally different concret</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:08:43 Every time you talk to a customer, you totally change your m</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:09:05 So when you're building a lot of applications, one of the bi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:09:55 So the speed of engineering is going up rapidly, and the cos</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:10:20 The other type of software I do is, write, maintain producti</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:10:41 But in terms of building quick and dirty prototypes, we're n</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:11:06 And I know I'm not supposed to tell people to write insecure</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:11:26 And like a leaking PII, leaking sends data, that is very dam</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:11:48 But I think by driving the cost of a proof of concept low en</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:12:08 I tend to tell my teams to move fast and be responsible.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:12:33 And then starting on our six, seven months ago, decided to d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:13:01 And the interesting thing is, if you're even half a generati</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:13:21 But because the cost of software engineering is going down, </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:13:38 Some of you may have heard of Jeff Bezos' terminology of a t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:13:58 Once you build on top of a certain tech stack, you know, set</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:14:17 I don't want to over-hype it. We don't do that all the time.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:14:36 Over the last year, a bunch of people advised, have advised </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:15:00 When we moved from assemblies, high-level languages like Cob</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:15:20 And as coding becomes easier, more people should learn to co</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:15:44 And I think I'm pretty little bit ahead of her for most busi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:16:06 And one of my team members knew art history.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:16:33 And I could never have the control that my collaborates are </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:16:55 And learning to code, not that you need to write the code yo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:17:19 A lot more of my teams have started to complain that the bot</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:17:38 It was this like p.m. product manager at the engineering rat</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:17:57 So literally yesterday, one of my teams came to me.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:18:19 I still don't know if this proposed I heard yesterday is a g</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:18:41 That helps you get faster as well.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:19:02 And if you're subject matter to expert, this is actually sur</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:19:27 When I travel, I often send the hotel lobby.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:19:47 And very respectfully, ask strangers, hey, we're building th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:20:08 Stem prototypes, 100 testers.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:20:30 It depends on how many users you have.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:20:54 I wish we were able to use the first tactic, to make high qu</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:21:15 That turns out to be really important.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:21:41 So many people, including non-tech people, have good instinc</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:22:00 So there are a lot of people that are really good at marketi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:22:24 Whereas if you need an HR problem, you can find someone that</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:22:40 How do you get a voice out to low latency?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:23:00 It feels like if you don't know the right answer, and most o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:23:26 The other reason why I find, staying on top of AI really hop</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:24:01 And this creates a lot of new opportunities for startups to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:24:19 But if you get a second building block, like you also know h</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:24:39 Get more building breaks, get more building breaks, and very</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:25:09 But when I look at the Deep Learning Diode I course catalog,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:25:30 I find that there are many things that matter for startup, n</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:25:52 I find that as a, as exactly if I'm judge on the speed and q</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:26:10 And if you haven't learned to go to coffee shop and talk to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:26:30 APPLAUSE I have a quick question.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:27:02 And so for a long time, there'll be a lot of things that hum</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:27:22 But so people that know how to use AI to get computers to do</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:27:42 My question is about the future of compute.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:28:06 So turns out there's one framework you can use for deciding </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:28:34 So one of my mental filters is there's certain hype narrativ</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:28:59 AI is so powerful soon no one will even have a job anymore.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:29:19 Yes, Jasper, Brandon Trouville, small number of companies go</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:29:41 I think we have a lot of room to run still for terrestrial G</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:30:02 But what are some of the most dangerous biases or over hyped</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:30:36 I find myself not using the term AI safety that much, not be</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:30:57 Like using electric electric motor can be used to build a Da</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:31:16 It is how you apply it that makes it safer unsafe.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:31:37 I think just one or two days ago, there was a Wall Street Jo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:32:02 And so these high narratives do keep on getting amplified.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:32:26 Whatever great mode product or feature you have can be repli</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:32:48 There goes market, channel, competitors, technology, mode.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:33:06 Do you have a channel to get to customers?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:33:28 But enterprise products, sometimes, if you have a, maybe mod</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:33:56 But I feel like at this moment in time, the number of opport</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:34:25 Although this is important to figure a long way.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:35:03 So which is different from static engineering?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:35:25 Only a small number of startups are lucky enough to have use</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:35:45 But it's actually really difficult to get to point where you</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:36:10 So for example, if you build a customer service chatbot or o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:36:38 So for example, have a lot of products that build on top of </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:36:59 And so the model we use week by week, you know, sometimes ou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:37:19 Switching costs for the orchestration platforms is a little </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:37:43 But another score of thought is that there'll be personal tu</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:38:00 Like don't think the disruption is here yet.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:38:19 Deep learning data AI slash avatile.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:38:42 But I think what I'm seeing is frankly tons of experimentati</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:39:02 The reality is work is complex, right?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:39:28 So I think I think we should all just keep working on it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:39:53 So I was curious, how do you think, you know, us as AI build</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:40:18 I know it sounds simple, but that's actually really hard to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-104">00:40:33 So I hope more people will do that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-105">00:40:56 So then everyone learned to code and then they got better.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:41:15 And my question is also about education.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:41:43 I think the knowledge will diffuse.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:42:05 And one of the reasons is there are two gatekeepers and Jord</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:42:37 Which thank goodness we shut down where the put in place rea</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:43:17 That's always a side for innovation and prevent the diffusio</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:43:42 But despite to protect open source, we've been winning, but </a></li>

<p>我认为AI技术栈底层是半导体公司，之上是云平台和基础模型。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:01:30,280', '00:01:52,439')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> And even though a lot of PR excitement and hype has been on these technology layers, it turns out that almost by definition, the biggest opportunities have to be at the application layer because we actually need the applications to generate even more revenue so that they can afford to pay the foundation, cloud and semiconductor technology layers.</p>
<p>尽管技术层备受关注，但最大机会必然在应用层，因为应用才能创造足够收入支撑底层技术。</p>

<p>媒体较少讨论应用层，但对创业者而言这里蕴藏最大机会。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:02:06,400', '00:02:14,799')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> One of the things that's changed a lot over the last year, and in terms of AI tech trends, if you ask me, what's the most important tech trend in AI?</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:02:14,800', '00:02:17,960')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> I would say is the rise of a gentigai.</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:02:17,960', '00:02:36,879')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> And about a year and a half ago, when I started to go around and give talks to try to convince people that AI agents might be a thing, I did not realize that around last summer, a bunch of marketers would get a hold of this term and use it as a sticker and slap it on everything in sight, which made it almost lose some of its meaning.</p>
<p>一年半前我推广AI智能体概念时，没想到去年夏天营销人员会滥用这个术语。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:02:36,878', '00:02:46,039')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> But I'll share with you from a technical perspective, why I think a gentigai is exciting and important, and also opens up a lot more startup opportunities.</p>
<p>但从技术角度看，智能体AI确实激动人心且能创造新机会。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:02:46,038', '00:02:51,639')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> So it turns out that the way a lot of us use LOMs is to prompt it to have it during an output.</p>

<p>这就像要求人类或AI一次性完成整篇文章。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:03:06,118', '00:03:11,000')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> And humans, we don't do our best writing, being forced to type in this linear order.</p>

<p>通过智能体，我们可以让AI系统先列提纲、做网络研究、写初稿、自我修订。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:03:33,080', '00:03:46,199')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> And so we end up with this iterative workflow, where your model does some thinking, and some research, does some revision, goes back to do more thinking, and by going around this loop many times, it is slower, but the deliver is a much better work product.</p>
<p>这种迭代工作流虽慢但产出质量更高。</p>

<p>智能体工作流效果显著，未来需将现有流程转化为智能体工作流。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:04:16,278', '00:04:32,119')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> So just to update the picture for the AI stack, what has emerged over the last year is a new agentic orchestration layer that helps application builders orchestrate or coordinate a lot of calls to the technology layers underneath.</p>
<p>AI技术栈新增了智能体编排层。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:04:32,119', '00:04:43,358')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> And the good news is, the orchestration layer has made it even easier to build applications, but I think the basic conclusion that the application layer has to be the most valuable layer to stack still holds true.</p>

<p>某些企业正以AI风险为由打压开源，试图垄断基础模型。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:42:27,539', '00:42:37,579')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> So I think, I think, I think, I think, danger is supposed to fall as dangerous of AI in order to get regulators to pass laws like the proposal SP 1047 in California.</p>
<p>所以我认为，我认为，我认为，我认为，为了促使监管机构通过像加州SP 1047提案这样的法律，AI的危险性被夸大了。</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:42:37,579', '00:42:48,980')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> Which thank goodness we shut down where the put in place really burdens some regulatory requirements that don't make anyone safer but would make it really difficult for tears to release open source and open weight software.</p>
<p>谢天谢地我们阻止了这项提案，因为它会实施一些真正繁重的监管要求，这些要求不会让任何人更安全，但会让开源和开放权重软件的发布变得非常困难。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:42:48,980', '00:43:00,780')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> So one of the dangers to inequality as well is if these regulatory, you know, awful regulatory approaches, and I've been in the room where some of these businesses set stuff to regulators that was just not true.</p>
<p>所以不平等的一个危险也是这些糟糕的监管方式，我曾亲眼目睹一些企业向监管机构陈述不实信息。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:43:00,780', '00:43:17,099')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> So I think that some of these arguments, the danger is if these regulatory proposals succeed and end up siphoning regulations, leaving us with a small number of gatekeepers where everyone needs the permission of a small number of companies to fine-tune them all from a certain way.</p>
<p>所以我认为这些论点中，危险在于如果这些监管提案成功并最终导致监管集中，我们将只剩下少数守门人，所有人都需要少数公司的许可才能以某种方式微调模型。</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:43:17,099', '00:43:26,940')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> That's always a side for innovation and prevent the diffusion of this information to let lots of startups build, whether they want responsibly, whether they free the innovate.</p>
<p>这总是会阻碍创新，并阻止信息的传播，使许多初创公司无法建设，无论他们是想负责任地发展还是自由创新。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:43:26,940', '00:43:36,619')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> So I think so long as we prevent this line of attack on open source open weight models from succeeding and would make good progress with a fitness still there.</p>
<p>所以我认为只要我们阻止对开源开放权重模型的这类攻击取得成功，并在保持适当性的同时取得良好进展。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:43:36,619', '00:43:42,218')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> Then I think eventually we get to the diffusion of knowledge and we can hopefully then bring everyone with us.</p>
<p>那么我认为最终我们会实现知识的传播，并有望带动所有人一起进步。</p>
