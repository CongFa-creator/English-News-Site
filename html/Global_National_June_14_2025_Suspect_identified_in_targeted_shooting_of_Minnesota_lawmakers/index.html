<p>I can remember in 2016 all the propaganda that was put out on North Korea and how they had a show for Kim Jong-un's birthday and all the rockets that they displayed and the nuclear weapons and the West took that as an insult and kind of a threat.</p>

<p>这是特朗普首任期推动的罕见阅兵，自1991年海湾战争胜利后首次。</p>
<p>Organizers for No Kings have called Saturday, which is also Flag Day in the United States, a nationwide day of defiance to reject authoritarianism, just days after Trump federalized the National Guard and sent active duty Marines to California to quell protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>抗议组织者将周六（美国国旗日）定为全国反专制日，此前特朗普刚派遣现役海军陆战队镇压洛杉矶移民抗议。</p>
