<li><a href="#block-22">00:07:33 So it seems again that you know these are the indications of</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:08:19 A military official uh in Israel speaking right after the co</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:09:02 President Trump in his first term uh pulled out from the dea</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:09:33 the authorities were saying that they would go ahead with uh</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:10:08 So we saw that you know in the last few days there had been </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:10:24 Just to add on to that Iranian state media report saying tha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:10:39 Well, let's cross over now to Bern Dusman who's at the at th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:11:02 Uh but other than that, there had been no real indication of</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:11:17 He said he didn't think it was imminent.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:11:46 And how are we expecting Donald Trump to react to this?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:12:08 Um, but on one hand, you know, he's been very steadfast in t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:12:31 Uh there was reports a few months ago that he had waved off </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:12:46 Um but there've been growing distance between the two sides </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:13:08 Bern, we understand that the White House is is saying that T</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:13:26 Well, I think the messaging we'll hear from President Trump </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:14:03 I think we'll hear very strong language from the administrat</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:14:21 Let's cross over to our State Department correspondent Tom B</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-40">00:15:21 Um uh and then we had this morning I mean I was in the state</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:15:47 But I think what is incredibly significant is the statement </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:16:03 The US we we are not involved in the strikes and they say ou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:16:26 That is extremely unusual.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:16:49 It was clear that President Trump had tried to uh stop uh th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:17:10 That that is extremely significant.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:17:31 There doesn't feel like any kind of that sense of organizati</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:17:45 And so, you're going to have to see the US probably try and </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:18:03 Mr. Netanyahu has in the past made a point of um trying to s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:18:24 Um the White House was enraged by his behavior that time aro</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:18:48 Uh a nuclear enrichment facility so says Benjamin Netanyahu </a></li>

<p>Uh tell us a bit more about the significance of Israel with with regards to who they're targeting.</p>
<p>请告诉我们更多关于以色列选择这些目标的意义。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>好的。</p>
<p>So, it is very interesting that what we're seeing that, you know, dozens of targets, military targets have been hit across the country, but also a number of high-profile assassinations uh also already uh you know, have been confirmed by the uh in Iran by state media in the country.</p>
<p>我们看到，伊朗境内数十个军事目标遭到打击，同时多名高调人物被刺杀，伊朗官方媒体已确认。</p>

<p>So it seems again that you know these are the indications of a really well planned uh large-scale attack uh Israeli attack targeting um Iran you know nuclear scientists and top military commanders and we saw again that the you know the authorities in Israel said that you know those dozens of locations hit included uh you know facilities with long range missiles and targets uh and targets linked to uh the country's nuclear program.</p>
<p>这似乎表明，以色列精心策划了大规模攻击，目标是伊朗的核科学家和高级军事指挥官。以色列当局称，被打击的数十个地点包括远程导弹设施和与核计划相关的目标。</p>
<p>So um again for quite some time uh the you know Israel had been warning you know the international community about the threats uh posed by uh Iran's nuclear program, Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>一段时间以来，以色列一直警告国际社会伊朗核计划和核野心构成的威胁。</p>

<p>A military official uh in Israel speaking right after the confirmation of these uh attacks came from the defense minister said that Iran had enough nuclear material to create 15 nuclear bombs within days and that Iran was advancing uh secret attempts to assemble those weapons and that could happen within uh in uh in in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>以色列一名军事官员在国防部长确认袭击后表示，伊朗拥有足够在几天内制造15枚核弹的材料，并正在秘密尝试组装这些武器，可能在短期内完成。</p>
<p>So uh again the Israeli authority saying that Iran had been advancing uh this nuclear program dismissing you know the Iranian position that uh its nuclear program was for peaceful purposes and again remember there was a deal that had been struck you know with Iran by the international community during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>以色列当局再次表示，伊朗一直在推进核计划，驳斥其和平目的的立场。国际社会曾在奥巴马政府时期与伊朗达成协议。</p>

<p>President Trump in his first term uh pulled out from the deal ever since he came back to office earlier this year.</p>

<p>What we've seen in recent weeks was that uh you know a number of American officials were saying that Iran wasn't making concessions in these negotiations uh and that some of Iran's demands uh in those talks were considered to be unacceptable by the Americans and that was the position uh in Israel as well.</p>

<p>the authorities were saying that they would go ahead with uh you know a military uh attack with some kind of military action against Iran if they considered the terms of any kind of deal to be unacceptable for uh Israel.</p>
<p>以色列当局表示，如果他们认为任何协议条款对以色列不可接受，将采取军事行动打击伊朗。</p>
<p>So during you know in the past few days we saw a number of measures uh that were announced in particular by the Trump administration including the evacuation of the embassy uh in Iraq because there is the fear that any kind of retaliation from uh Iran could also involve American assets becoming targets across the Middle East.</p>

<p>去年以伊至少两次直接交火并升级。</p>
<p>Um the Americans basically organized a defensive coalition to help Israel defend itself against the missile strikes from the Iranians.</p>
<p>当时美国组织防御联盟协助以色列抵御伊朗导弹袭击。</p>

<p>There doesn't feel like any kind of that sense of organization this time around.</p>
<p>这次却毫无此类组织迹象。</p>
<p>you know, Israelis were woken up by aid sirens and they've said this was to wake people up, not because of incoming Iranian missiles, but that I think is almost inevitable now, an Iranian counterattack.</p>
<p>以色列人曾被警报声惊醒，官方称仅为警示而非伊朗导弹来袭，但伊朗反击现在几乎不可避免。</p>

<p>And so, you're going to have to see the US probably try and scramble to help the Israelis uh without that sort of sense of organization last time.</p>
<p>美国可能仓促援以，但不会像上次那样有组织。</p>
<p>But beyond that, even that isn't abundantly clear.</p>
<p>即便如此，这点也不明确。</p>
<p>And remember, there's been an extremely fractious relationship between Mr. Netanyahu um and President Trump.</p>
<p>内塔尼亚胡与特朗普关系极度紧张。</p>

<p>Mr. Netanyahu has in the past made a point of um trying to show to Washington that he is prepared to act unilaterally what in what he in the way that he thinks is in Israel's self-interest.</p>
<p>内塔尼亚胡曾刻意向华盛顿展示其准备单边行动维护以色列利益。</p>
<p>Remember he tried to derail the first nuclear deal under President Obama by basically going behind President Obama's back making direct appeals to Republicans in Washington.</p>
<p>他曾绕过奥巴马直接游说共和党人破坏伊核协议。</p>

<p>Um the White House was enraged by his behavior that time around.</p>
<p>白宫当时对其行为震怒。</p>
<p>So you've got a very fractious relationship between these two men at an absolutely critical moment now with the chance of a far far greater escalation in the Middle East now very possible and potentially likely and we're seeing very widescale attacks at least six locations across Iran.</p>
<p>此刻二人关系极度紧张，中东局势极可能大幅升级，伊朗至少六处地点遭大规模袭击。</p>

<p>Uh a nuclear enrichment facility so says Benjamin Netanyahu at Natans has been attacked.</p>
<p>内塔尼亚胡称纳坦兹核设施遇袭。</p>
<p>um civilian casualties.</p>
<p>出现平民伤亡。</p>
<p>Iranian state media talking about civilians including women and children they say killed in one strike in Iran.</p>
<p>伊朗官媒称包括妇女儿童在内的平民在袭击中丧生。</p>
<p>It's clear that assassinations are involved of um you know nuclear officials.</p>
<p>显然有核官员遭暗杀。</p>

<p>So this is a big attack, very widespread amid a sort of fractious relationship between Israel and its absolutely key ally, the United States, when it comes to um its defensive posture in the Middle system.</p>
<p>这是以色列与关键盟友美国关系紧张之际发起的大规模广泛袭击，事关其中东防御态势。</p>
