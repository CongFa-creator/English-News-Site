<p>Dashi Neat, what's behind this?</p>
<p>原因何在？</p>
<p>Then people tightening the belts a little bit more last month.</p>
<p>民众上月进一步缩减开支。</p>
<p>Well, there's quite a lot to this because, as you say, after a bumper few months at the start of the year for retailers, the party seems so grand to our halt in May with retail sales falling by 2.7%.</p>
<p>年初零售业繁荣后，五月销售额骤降2.7%。</p>

<p>Those are volumes and that is adjusted for what normally happens, so seasonally what happens.</p>
<p>此为经季节性调整后的销量数据。</p>
<p>Having said that, these monthly figures have been particularly volatile over the last few months.</p>
<p>但近几月数据波动显著。</p>
<p>When you start on picking them, there are some good reasons why we had that early arrival of spring, which means that a lot of people went out and bought spring in summer clothes quite early and people finished their DIY products quite early as well.</p>
<p>早春促使夏装和DIY产品提前消费。</p>

<p>So those kind of sales fell back in May and you mentioned supermarkets there.</p>
<p>此类销售五月回落，超市业尤甚。</p>
<p>Well, we had that late Easter.</p>

<p>The news came as a shock.</p>
<p>这个消息令人震惊。</p>
<p>So we definitely like to have known about it earlier because with this condition, it only really improves until their age 7 and at the age of 7, they can't really make a lot more improvement by doing the patching.</p>
<p>我们当然希望早点知道，因为这种状况在7岁前才能真正改善，而到了7岁，通过遮盖疗法也无法取得更多进展。</p>
<p>So if we'd known about it when he was three or four, or perhaps at the start of school, then he would have had longer to work on it.</p>

<p>Now when you've spoken with people who this might affect people with a terminal diagnosis what are their thoughts on having this option on the table?</p>
<p>当你与可能受此影响的绝症患者交谈时，他们对这一选择有何看法？</p>
<p>Well on both sides there are very strong arguments here those in favour of assisted dying say this is about autonomy.</p>
<p>双方都有非常有力的论据，支持安乐死的人说这是关于自主权。</p>

<p>It's about allowing people to be sure that they won't suffer at the end of life and give them choice.</p>
<p>这是为了让人们确信他们不会在生命结束时受苦，并给他们选择。</p>

<p>反对者认为一个人的死亡权会成为另一个人的死亡义务，他们担心弱势群体或残疾人士受到胁迫。</p>

<p>I've got to be well enough to be able to travel so I may have to travel before I'm really ready.</p>
<p>我必须足够健康才能旅行，所以我可能不得不在我真正准备好之前旅行。</p>

<p>你知道我不想在我还能享受生活的时候离开，但我认为这将使我处于那种境地，我可能不得不独自前往。</p>
