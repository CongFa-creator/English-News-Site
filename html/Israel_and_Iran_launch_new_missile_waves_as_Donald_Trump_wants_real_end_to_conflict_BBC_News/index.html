<h1>Israel and Iran launch new missile waves as Donald Trump wants ‘real end’ to conflict | BBC News</h1>
<p>【以色列和伊朗发动新一轮导弹袭击，唐纳德·特朗普呼吁“真正结束”冲突 | BBC新闻】</p>
<p>Summary:
There has been a major development in the Middle East involving Israel, Iran, and the Gaza Strip. Former U.S. President Trump has cut short his G7 summit trip and returned to Washington, emphasizing that he will not negotiate with Iran and insisting that Iran must not possess nuclear weapons. Countries such as China and Russia have called on their citizens to evacuate Iran and Israel, while the European Union warned that U.S. involvement could trigger a wider conflict. Israel and Iran continue to launch attacks on each other, resulting in more casualties. Iran claims it has struck Israel's intelligence headquarters, while Israel has targeted Iran’s missile launch sites. The International Atomic Energy Agency has discovered new evidence of damage to Iran’s nuclear facilities. Israeli public opinion is divided on the government’s actions — some support continued strikes on Iran’s nuclear program, while others are concerned that the escalating conflict could jeopardize hostage negotiations in Gaza. Israel’s foreign minister outlined three major military objectives: to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, its ballistic missile program, and its intent to eliminate Israel, but denied seeking regime change.</p>
<p>摘要：
中东局势出现重大进展，涉及以色列、伊朗和加沙地区。特朗普缩短G7峰会行程返回华盛顿，强调不会与伊朗谈判，要求伊朗不得拥有核武器。中俄等国呼吁公民撤离伊朗和以色列，欧盟警告美国介入可能引发更广泛冲突。以伊双方持续互相袭击，造成更多伤亡，伊朗称击中以色列情报总部，以色列则打击伊朗导弹发射场。国际原子能机构发现伊朗核设施受损新证据。以色列民众对政府行动意见不一，部分支持继续打击伊朗核计划，部分担忧冲突升级影响加沙人质谈判。以外长明确军事行动三大目标：摧毁伊朗核计划、弹道导弹计划和消灭以色列的企图，但否认寻求政权更迭。</p>

<p>我身后公交站今晨遭伊朗导弹袭击。</p>

<p>They saw plumes of smoke when this happened.</p>

<p>So uh this is one of the main uh direct hits that has been reported as part of those retalitary Iranian strikes today.</p>
