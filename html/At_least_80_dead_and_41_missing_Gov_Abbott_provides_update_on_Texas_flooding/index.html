<li><a href="#block-34">00:16:11 But critically, stay off the lakes.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:16:33 Next. What the governor said we have a lot of saturation.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:16:59 Thank you, governor. Pretty good, cloud chief Jim. Kate.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:17:19 And they had a lot of people there that were not from that a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:17:39 We owe them a great amount of gratitude.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:17:57 Be very careful how you use that word, because I'm going to </a></li>

<li><a href="#block-41">00:18:49 Stay out of the area because you don't know the area.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:19:08 The next thing is, we see a lot of information on social med</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:19:27 There is a process that we use to get volunteers into the re</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:19:59 So it's before all of the actual flooding and disaster start</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-46">00:20:46 You just said something about wild water that you're just no</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-50">00:22:22 under the state disaster declaration includes, the following</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:23:12 So for now, local resources have to stop search and rescue e</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:23:38 you know, this helps with funding and additional resources a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:24:07 So we still have Coast Guard assets here, and they will oper</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:24:26 So there were multiple steps taken by the state that I'll le</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:24:54 as we learn more on Thursday, more assets were provided in v</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:25:26 We need to spend a lot of time trying to answer this questio</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:25:50 And I pause the integrated public alert and warning system a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:26:07 I'll ask you, how many of you have a know a weather radio by</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:26:26 Having a plan to do something when you receive the message a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:26:47 Let me add this also.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:27:12 And the point that he made was that by the moment of time wh</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:27:37 And so local officials know the best about the terrain, abou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:28:00 And how years and years of experience.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:28:21 And it's my understanding that what they put out was, kind o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:28:49 Just like, put people on notice in these regions of Texas th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:29:09 Are you communicating with your federal partners on how crit</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:29:29 And the way to respond to, like, what happened is going to b</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:29:53 This is an area that deals with flash flooding, but there we</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:30:17 And they have their own ways in which to deal with warnings </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:30:49 Couple one more folks.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:31:11 Yeah, we're just wondering if.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:31:30 Thank you all.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:31:55 It is continuing to rain there.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:32:17 That is an area where they are continuing to look for a numb</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:32:47 And I understand Ed Lavandera is also in Ingram, Texas.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:33:10 That is the biggest concern That's top of mind is this wall </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:33:35 When suddenly we saw one of these, cruisers from Kerr County</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:33:57 We also then shortly after that got this text message, an em</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:34:19 From what I've heard, he's only allowing people, people who </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:34:38 But still, we learned our lesson.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:34:58 Also with us now from Ingram.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:35:24 They were telling everybody just to scramble out of there as</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-84">00:36:05 In that area that they were the most concerned about at the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:36:28 But right now, there are hundreds, if not thousands of peopl</a></li>
