<li><a href="#block-18">00:08:39 hits now more than 20 hectares.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:09:01 It's hard to describe the anxiety that happens when there is</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:09:23 Have you ever had to experience something like this before t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:09:41 I was a tree planter in a small town that I grew up in calle</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:10:07 And uh we had to flee um this area that we loved um driving </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:10:34 That is Amber Cowi, a Squamish resident.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:10:51 And along the Highway 97 corridor, the smoke from the wildfi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:11:07 And the third fire of note there, the massive Pocket Knife C</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:11:26 The province says things are pointing to an active wildfire </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:11:44 So, what are the lessons that we can learn and what can be d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:12:04 And welcome to people watching us live on Tik Tok.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:12:22 Hi Lori, good afternoon.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:12:41 We are doing assessments of the fire severity and then looki</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:12:58 Cisco um the community forest had done a lot of proactive fo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:13:19 What what can you tell us about what you're learning so far?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:13:37 It's scarring the trees, but the scar the char on the height</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:13:57 The char goes right up into the crowns of the trees and many</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:14:18 Yes. So, so, um, we learned, you know, we were talking a few</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:14:40 So, thinning from below, leaving the big canopy trees in pla</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:14:57 It reduces the impact of the fire.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:15:12 But we've also had tremendous successes.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:15:29 It's so interesting to me to see the the thin uh brush behin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:15:44 I'm going to put the phone numbers out uh once again asking </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:15:58 So, if you've experienced an evacuation uh or or or lived ne</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:16:19 And if you're watching us on Tik Tok live, certainly leave y</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:16:37 What goes through your mind then?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:16:58 Um and and fire danger creeping up.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:17:15 Um and thinking about how do we protect our homes in the cas</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:17:34 And then the last I'll add is all of us need to be so carefu</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:17:53 Um there is this uh suspicion that the uh Dryen Creek wildfi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:18:15 It could be recreational activity, ATVs, campfires that are </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:18:34 Um, it could also be industrial activities.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:18:56 On that note, why do we still see human-caused fire?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:19:14 But Ravi Parmar, the forest minister, said the other day, we</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:19:35 Um and so the weather system by the end of the summer really</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:19:53 Now, think about where are we, you know, where are people in</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:20:10 Those fires that are human cause are often the ones that hav</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:20:26 Oh, what goes through your mind when you think of that, Lori</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:20:44 Overall in BC in the last 8 years alone we have burned over </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:21:08 I mean, the onus really is on all of us to be better informe</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:21:25 And we are asking you, what are the lessons BC needs to lear</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:21:49 Our email is bctoday at cbc.ca and uh on Tik Tok you can com</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:22:11 We have known about fire hazards for many years and for week</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:22:29 Please people, stop demanding your quote right to campfires </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:22:50 Hi Sharon.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:23:11 But not only people our city hall here, I spoke to them two </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:23:27 And I don't know.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:23:47 They are not made of it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:24:14 That's how dangerous it is because of the weather patterns t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:24:41 So what goes through your mind hearing her frustration there</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:25:01 Those are actually the turppen.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:25:28 So, I strongly recommend um our native trees uh depending on</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:25:57 And would that be incentives or or how uh motivated are muni</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:26:19 So, um I would simply recommend to every homeowner get on to</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:26:41 Um, and so it's doable.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:26:53 Yeah. Make it a project.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:27:03 You're you're in the vicinity of our guest here, Lori Daniel</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:27:24 That is a misnomer. You can't control fire and the ministry </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:27:39 Um, and they used the Martin Mars, which of course we no lon</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:27:55 I could see it directly from my driveway, although I'm 20 ki</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:28:16 The ministry has been telling us since 2016 that we've been </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:28:35 Uh we need to restore initial attack and um we need to quit </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:29:00 They went two valleys away from Trro to try to make it a mas</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-84">00:30:10 Penalties need to be more severe.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:30:26 We need to act sooner with more force.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:30:50 This is the ultimate human cause of the increase in these fi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:31:05 They had firewatch helicopters fly all the tree farms every </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:31:20 BC today at cbc.ca for more of your thoughts.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:32:04 Yeah, so I hear people's frustration and we are running into</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:32:27 Um when fires ignite there has to be kind of a triage a prio</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:32:55 So we are having to come up with new strategies and techniqu</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:33:12 Um certainly that will that will help where we have um more </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:33:33 Kind of using that uh that local knowledge can really really</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:33:51 Thank you so much for making the time for us.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-112">00:39:32 You can hit pound690 on your cell phone.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:39:49 It is the largest youth employer in the province.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:40:07 Whether you are looking for full-time, part-time, seasonal, </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:40:25 Um this year we'll be hiring about 800 positions um to that'</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:40:50 And for many decades, the P&amp; has considered itself a leader </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:41:18 So, what does that what does this year look like?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:41:34 Um that we all um you know, myself, I started at the P&amp; in t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-119">00:41:54 There's other people that um, like to return over year-over-</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-120">00:42:11 So what are you hearing from young people then when it comes</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-121">00:42:37 And it you know it is sad if there is young people that are </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-122">00:43:08 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-123">00:43:27 I think what we what we will see and what we've traditionall</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-124">00:44:06 And I think what we're seeing is with the tightening economy</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-125">00:44:27 So, you know, uh the reasons for working are vast.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-126">00:44:50 Um I think all of those things appeal and uh but we will see</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-127">00:45:22 The P&amp; as a not for-p profofit um has always taken the posit</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-128">00:46:09 So, we're asking you, have you been affected?</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-132">00:47:25 15 to 24, right?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:47:50 Uh entry level.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-134">00:48:13 And that's in the face of that kind of criticism when it com</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-135">00:48:48 Yeah, it was it was unfortunate because he he did like they </a></li>

<li><a href="#block-144">00:51:19 the the Facebook marketplace bakers, the the pet care sitter</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-145">00:51:36 But I do think there's a large um percentage of the populati</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-146">00:52:03 Can you deal with high volumes in our in the case of our fai</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-147">00:52:27 Let's uh go through some of your more of your comments now.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-151">00:53:51 And uh we have a comment on Tik Tok from Schmitten who write</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-152">00:54:05 And so in 2024, Canada did introduce uh changes to that temp</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-153">00:54:29 Um the exceptions would be things like healthcare constructi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-154">00:54:48 Um what what can young people be thinking about in terms of </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-155">00:55:25 We have a large number of departments and I think in the cas</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-156">00:55:47 I'll tell you a little fun little uh trivia uh thing.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-157">00:56:29 But then the question was what's the worst job?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-158">00:57:03 And so they actually consider it and it's one of the most de</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-159">00:57:25 But it's an interesting point because we were talking earlie</a></li>

<p>Well, now is the time for all of us to kind of think about those fires smart principles.</p>
<p>现在是我们所有人思考“火灾智能”原则的时候了。</p>
<p>We are seeing um up in the northeast, very active fires and a lot of smoke.</p>

<p>火灾风险正在上升。</p>
<p>So thinking about what do we need to do be to be fires smart in our own homes.</p>
<p>因此，我们需要思考如何让家庭更“火灾智能”。</p>
<p>Making sure roof lines are clear of burnable debris like leaves and needles.</p>
<p>确保屋顶没有可燃杂物，如树叶和松针。</p>
<p>Cleaning up that 1.5 meter space right around our yards.</p>

<p>思考如何在野火发生时保护家园。</p>
<p>Um really great advice coming from BC Wildfire and Emergency Services.</p>
<p>BC野火和应急服务部门提供了很好的建议。</p>
<p>Get your grabandgo bag ready.</p>
<p>准备好应急包。</p>
<p>Make sure that you've got it prepared to go.</p>

<h3>00:17:34</h3>
<p>And then the last I'll add is all of us need to be so careful when we are outside enjoying our beautiful province um camping and recreating and using all these trails that uh and and parks that are so valuable to us.</p>
<p>最后，我们在户外享受美丽的BC省时需格外小心，无论是露营、休闲还是使用珍贵的步道和公园。</p>
<p>There's that.</p>
<p>就是这样。</p>
<p>And Squamish is a place where so much of that recreating happens.</p>

<h3>00:17:53</h3>
<p>Um there is this uh suspicion that the uh Dryen Creek wildfire is human-caused.</p>
<p>有人怀疑德莱恩溪野火是人为引起的。</p>
<p>What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p>具体是什么意思？</p>
<p>So human-caused fires are fires that came from a non-natural system or non-natural source.</p>
<p>人为火灾是指由非自然系统或非自然源引起的火灾。</p>
<p>So lightning would be our primary natural source of fire um here in BC and other fires are started by people.</p>
<p>在BC省，闪电是主要的自然火源，其他火灾由人为引发。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-48"></a></p>
<h3>00:18:15</h3>
<p>It could be recreational activity, ATVs, campfires that are left or not properly extinguished at the end of a a camping trip.</p>
<p>可能是休闲活动、全地形车、未熄灭或未妥善处理的营火。</p>
<p>Um, it could be debris that was left in the forest that acts like a magnifier and actually starts.</p>
<p>可能是遗留在森林中像放大镜一样引发火灾的杂物。</p>
<p>So, littering and garbage in the forest can be a contributing factor.</p>
<p>因此，森林中的垃圾可能是诱因之一。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-49"></a></p>
<h3>00:18:34</h3>
<p>Um, it could also be industrial activities.</p>
<p>也可能是工业活动。</p>
<p>Um although we know that industrial activities are controlled and restricted when fire danger becomes high enough um people are you know are not allowed to be out in the forest um actually working in um jobs that could create a spark or could potentially start a fire.</p>
<p>尽管我们知道在火灾风险高时工业活动会受到限制，禁止人们在森林中从事可能产生火花或引发火灾的工作。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-50"></a></p>
<h3>00:18:56</h3>
<p>On that note, why do we still see human-caused fire?</p>
<p>既然如此，为何仍有人为火灾？</p>
<p>So there are penalties, right?</p>
<p>因为有处罚措施，对吧？</p>
<p>So for um anyone found in controvention of a BC wildfire service prohibition, you may be issued a ticket for more than $1,100 or a penalty up to $100,000, even sentenced for up to one year in prison.</p>
<p>违反BC野火服务禁令者可能被罚款1100加元以上，最高10万加元，甚至面临一年监禁。</p>

<h3>00:19:14</h3>
<p>But Ravi Parmar, the forest minister, said the other day, we believe that about 70% of the wildfires so far are human cause.</p>
<p>但林业部长拉维·帕马尔日前表示，我们认为目前约70%的野火是人为引起的。</p>
<p>Why does this keep happening?</p>
<p>为何这种情况持续发生？</p>
<p>Yeah. So in the spring, so our weather systems by July and August, we get those big thunderheads that build up in the in the afternoon and kind of spark um lightning in the late afternoon and into the evenings.</p>
<p>春季与七八月的天气系统不同，后者会在下午形成雷暴云，傍晚产生闪电。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-52"></a></p>
<h3>00:19:35</h3>
<p>Um and so the weather system by the end of the summer really is generating that lightning at this time of year.</p>
<p>因此，夏末的天气系统此时确实会引发闪电。</p>
<p>However, in the spring, we don't have the same weather systems.</p>
<p>但春季没有相同的天气系统。</p>
<p>So the majority of fires in the spring um in in May, June in British Columbia and across Canada are actually human ignitions.</p>
<p>因此，BC省乃至加拿大五六月的大多数火灾实际上是人为引发的。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-53"></a></p>
<h3>00:19:53</h3>
<p>Now, think about where are we, you know, where are people interacting with the forest?</p>
<p>想想人们与森林互动的区域——</p>
<p>Well, in and around our communities, on trails, in recreational areas, right near our homes.</p>
<p>在我们的社区、步道、休闲区，家园附近。</p>
<p>So, it not only means that there's many people out in the woods and a subset of those people might be starting fires.</p>
<p>这意味着不仅有许多人在森林活动，其中一部分人可能引发火灾。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-54"></a></p>
<h3>00:20:10</h3>
<p>Those fires that are human cause are often the ones that have the greatest impact on our homes.</p>
<p>人为火灾通常对家园影响最大。</p>
<p>They're in the wildland urban interface.</p>
<p>它们发生在城乡交界处。</p>
<p>So the majority of fires that happen in that wildland interface zone within 2 kilometers of homes and neighborhoods are caused.</p>
<p>因此，住宅区2公里内的大多数火灾是人为引起的。</p>

<p>洛瑞，作为研究野火季节后果的人，你对此有何看法？</p>
<p>Well, here I am, you know, out in the forest.</p>

<p>Overall in BC in the last 8 years alone we have burned over 7.2 million hectares that's two and a half times the size of Vancouver Island in wildfires and about half of those were started by people.</p>
<p>过去8年BC省共烧毁720万公顷，是温哥华岛的2.5倍，其中约半数为人为引发。</p>

<p>BC Gardener has talked to about this for years and uh I I just find that so aggravating that we can't because I will just add say one more thing.</p>
<p>BC园艺师多年来一直呼吁，这令人沮丧——我还要补充一点：</p>
<p>When we had the wildfire here just a few years ago on the west side of the lake that fire sent a a big branch flaming branch across the lake over the hill and landed here on the south end of Wood Lake in my friend's yard right beside her cedar hedge.</p>
<p>几年前湖边西侧的野火将燃烧的大树枝吹过湖面山坡，落在伍德湖南端我朋友家雪松树篱旁的院子里。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-66"></a></p>
<h3>00:24:14</h3>
<p>That's how dangerous it is because of the weather patterns that happened during those wildfires.</p>
<p>这就是野火期间天气模式带来的危险。</p>
<p>Oh, Sharon, thank you very much for raising that.</p>
<p>莎伦，感谢提出这一点。</p>
<p>And uh you're right.</p>
<p>你是对的。</p>
<p>So, I was thinking about this the other day, Lori, as I was walking through, I mean, a park in Vancouver, looking at the kinds of trees and the broad leaves, and I was thinking about what are the the the most uh you know, fire um uh fires safe types of of trees and bushes that people should be thinking about.</p>
<p>洛瑞，前几天我在温哥华公园散步时思考哪些树木和灌木最防火。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-67"></a></p>
<h3>00:24:41</h3>
<p>So what goes through your mind hearing her frustration there around the amount of cedar hedges?</p>
<p>听到她对雪松树篱数量的不满，你有何想法？</p>
<p>Cedar hedges and also in the interior a lot of people landscape with juniper.</p>
<p>雪松树篱和内陆许多人使用的杜松景观。</p>
<p>So both of them are highly flammable and you can think of plants that are very aromatic that have those kind of we kind of think of them as the pine scent that comes off of them.</p>
<p>它们都高度易燃，那些散发松香味的芳香植物也是。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-68"></a></p>
<h3>00:25:01</h3>
<p>Those are actually the turppen.</p>
<p>那些是萜烯类物质。</p>
<p>Those are chemicals within the the foliage and the fine branches of that vegetation that makes it highly flammable.</p>
<p>这些存在于枝叶中的化学物质使其极易燃烧。</p>
<p>So, Firesmart also gives great advice about avoiding those types of plants um and gives advice about broadleaf native shrubs and herbs um that can be used in our gardens in substitutes that can provide shade that are beautiful for landscaping and are more fire resistant.</p>
<p>“火灾智能”指南建议避免这类植物，推荐本地阔叶灌木和草本作为替代，既美观遮荫又更防火。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-69"></a></p>
<h3>00:25:28</h3>
<p>So, I strongly recommend um our native trees uh depending on what part of the province you're in are adapted to fire in different ways, but again, reducing their density, um pruning some of the lower branches, and then if you have trees near your home, creating shade, which can be a benefit because of climate change and heat and drought.</p>
<p>我强烈建议根据所在区域选择适应火灾的本地树种，同时降低密度、修剪低枝，房屋附近的树木可提供遮荫，这对应对气候变化和高温干旱有益。</p>
<p>We also want to make sure we've trimmed the branches so they're not hanging right over your eaves troughing and right over your roof and potentially um contributing to a fire hazard.</p>
<p>我们还需要确保修剪树枝，避免它们悬垂在屋檐排水沟或屋顶上方，可能增加火灾隐患。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-70"></a></p>
<h3>00:25:57</h3>
<p>And would that be incentives or or how uh motivated are municipalities to make those kinds of changes?</p>
<p>这些措施是否需要激励？或者地方政府有多大动力去推动这类改变？</p>
<p>So many municipalities have good rules for new builds and as new um new neighborhoods are being developed and new houses are being built, it's a little bit harder to have this requirement kind of retroactively.</p>
<p>许多城市对新建筑有严格规定，但对于已建成的社区和房屋，追溯实施这些要求较为困难。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<h3>00:26:19</h3>
<p>So, um I would simply recommend to every homeowner get on to that Fire Smart BC website.</p>
<p>因此，我建议每位业主访问Fire Smart BC网站。</p>
<p>It has fantastic advice of things that you can do.</p>
<p>网站提供了许多实用的建议。</p>

<p>这是个错误的说法。火势无法控制，政府部门需要明白这一点。</p>

<p>The Martin Mars puts out fires. Water bombers put out fires.</p>

<p>Helicopters are very inefficient and very, very expensive.</p>

<p>他们想关闭整个山谷。</p>
<p>We need to quit having these people who want to have a project fire.</p>
<p>我们需要阻止那些把火灾当项目的人。</p>
<p>And I can tell you that the ministry has ended up at many different fires where it's a very small fire that could be put out by a few people and yet they chose to not touch it and create a project.</p>

<h3>00:32:04</h3>
<p>Yeah, so I hear people's frustration and we are running into problems where we are getting multiple ignitions across all of the province um at the same time.</p>
<p>我理解大家的沮丧，我们正面临全省多地同时起火的问题。</p>
<p>And so when we have these large when we have fire seasons uh like the 2023 or 2021 2018 2017 fire season where so much of the province is under very high to extreme fire danger.</p>
<p>在2023、2021、2018和2017年的火灾季节，全省大部分地区处于极高火灾风险中。</p>

<p>Um when fires ignite there has to be kind of a triage a prior a prioritization of those fires.</p>
<p>火灾发生时，必须优先处理某些火灾。</p>
<p>Which ones can they get to you know can firefighters get to effectively um and quickly um and which ones um unfortunately have to wait.</p>
<p>哪些火灾可以快速有效扑灭，哪些只能暂时搁置。</p>
<p>And so this is becoming more and more challenging as we are seeing the number of fires um upwards of 60 fires of note simultaneously in the 2018 fire season as an example.</p>

<p>Um certainly that will that will help where we have um more type one, type two, type three.</p>
<p>这将有助于增加一类、二类和三类消防员。</p>
<p>So provincial government employees directly but also contract crews, professional um forest professionals and wildland firefighters distributed around the province who can also be contracted to BC wildfire and contribute if there's fires in their local areas.</p>
<p>包括省政府直接雇员、合同消防队、专业林业人员和分布全省的野外消防员，他们可以在当地火灾时协助BC野火消防局。</p>

<p>It is the largest youth employer in the province.</p>
<p>这是本省最大的青年雇主。</p>
<p>Laura, thanks so much for being with us.</p>
<p>劳拉，感谢做客节目。</p>
<p>Welcome to the show.</p>
<p>欢迎您。</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p>非常感谢邀请。</p>
<p>What are you hearing about what the job market is like right now for young people?</p>
<p>您了解到当前青年就业市场情况如何？</p>
<p>Well, you know, the P&amp; is a place that generally has a wide variety of job categories.</p>
<p>P&amp;E提供多种岗位类型。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-114"></a></p>
<h3>00:40:07</h3>
<p>Whether you are looking for full-time, part-time, seasonal, fairtime work, uh we have a really diverse set of offerings of types of events uh that happen on our site.</p>
<p>无论是全职、兼职、季节性还是临时工作，我们都有丰富选择。</p>
<p>Right now we're just in the process of hiring for our best known entity, which is our annual summer fair, right?</p>
<p>目前我们正在为年度夏季展会招聘。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-115"></a></p>
<h3>00:40:25</h3>
<p>Um this year we'll be hiring about 800 positions um to that'll be seasonal positions for for the fair.</p>
<p>今年将提供约800个展会季节性岗位。</p>
<p>It's interesting.</p>
<p>值得注意的是，</p>
<p>Um, I will say that the P&amp; we're always proud.</p>
<p>我们始终以P&amp;E为傲。</p>
<p>We think that um, we have very strong employee education programs.</p>
<p>我们拥有完善的员工培训体系。</p>
<p>We are a fun place to work and we train people well well to set them up for that next job.</p>
<p>工作氛围愉快，培训扎实，为员工职业发展奠定基础。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-116"></a></p>
<h3>00:40:50</h3>
<p>And for many decades, the P&amp; has considered itself a leader in creating an environment where people that are um looking for their first job, maybe their first job in Canada, can come and and get some important skills, get some good training, and maybe move on then to that second uh and then ultimately third over their career.</p>
<p>数十年来，P&amp;E始终致力于为首次求职者（包括新移民）提供技能培训，助力职业晋升。</p>
<p>And so that that yeah, an important part of our role in the Lower Mainland and in the province.</p>
<p>这是我们在低陆平原和全省的重要使命。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-117"></a></p>
<h3>00:41:18</h3>
<p>So, what does that what does this year look like?</p>
<p>今年情况如何？</p>
<p>I when you say 800 positions, how does that compare to previous years?</p>
<p>800个岗位相较往年有何变化？</p>
<p>Well, I will say that the number of positions is probably um a little lower only because we do have a a high percentage of folks returning this year.</p>
<p>岗位数量略减，因今年老员工返岗率较高。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-118"></a></p>
<h3>00:41:34</h3>
<p>Um that we all um you know, myself, I started at the P&amp; in the '9s on a two-month contract.</p>
<p>比如我本人90年代就以两个月合同入职。</p>
<p>Um, so there's a component of our team that um, you fall in love with the place, you fall in love with the history and and the the um, feeling of working at PE and and that collective history of the province.</p>
<p>许多员工热爱这里的历史氛围和集体归属感。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-119"></a></p>
<h3>00:41:54</h3>
<p>There's other people that um, like to return over year-over-year because of the diversity of jobs.</p>
<p>也有人因岗位多样性连年回归。</p>
<p>You can start in the food and beverage area, then you can move to security or guest experience and you can really round out your resume um you know with a number of different skill sets that you can.</p>
<p>可以从餐饮起步，转岗安保或客户服务，丰富简历技能。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-120"></a></p>
<h3>00:42:11</h3>
<p>So what are you hearing from young people then when it comes to this job market and what goes through your mind when you hear that we are BC has the second lowest I think it was 16% when it comes to unemployment um in May.</p>
<p>听到BC五月16%的失业率（全国第二高）时，您从青年群体了解到什么？</p>
<p>That's that's very unfortunate because I know um you know so many youth are looking to do things like um you know raise money to fund their their university and post-secary pursuits and things like that.</p>
<p>这很不幸，因为许多青年需要赚取大学或深造费用。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-121"></a></p>
<h3>00:42:37</h3>
<p>And it you know it is sad if there is young people that are willing to work um or anyone but but if for the purposes of this we're talking about youth that are looking for a job and and simply can't find it.</p>
<p>有意愿工作却找不到岗位令人遗憾。</p>
<p>I will say that this year we have about 800 entry or openings and we have had over 5,500 people apply for those 800 jobs which is um a very response and and probably an indication of the statistics that you are quoting here.</p>
<p>今年800个初级岗位收到超5500份申请，印证了您提到的数据。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-122"></a></p>
<h3>00:43:08</h3>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>确实。</p>
<p>Um, have you seen at the P&amp; any impact from some of the factors that they're saying uh are contributing to this uh slowing economy um that started last year?</p>
<p>P&amp;E是否受到去年开始的经济放缓因素影响？</p>
<p>Uncertainty from the the trade and tariff war with the United States.</p>
<p>比如美加贸易关税战的不确定性。</p>
<p>Are you seeing any impact from that at at the fair?</p>
<p>展会有受影响吗？</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-123"></a></p>
<h3>00:43:27</h3>
<p>I think what we what we will see and what we've traditionally seen at the P&amp; is people getting that second job or they'll work for the summer to augment um their their year round revenue teachers um folks like that that that need that little bit extra and um you know in previous years my colleagues and folks that I would talk to um maybe that's the you know they'll work for the three years they worked at the P&amp; um back in university or high school and they continue on because of the tradition in the family atmosphere.</p>
<p>传统上，P&amp;E常见暑期兼职教师等需要额外收入的人群。许多员工因家庭传统从学生时代工作至今。</p>
<p>But now today, maybe it funds um car payments or it funds a family vacation or other things like that.</p>
<p>如今收入可能用于车贷或家庭旅行。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-124"></a></p>
<h3>00:44:06</h3>
<p>And I think what we're seeing is with the tightening economy, more people are being forced to look at ways to augment um existing income.</p>
<p>经济紧缩下，越来越多人寻求增收途径。</p>
<p>And I think youth in particular are looking for ways to be able to afford the things that um that that you youth want in these day and age that maybe mom and dad can't can't purchase at this time.</p>
<p>青年尤其需要支付父母无法承担的开销。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-125"></a></p>
<h3>00:44:27</h3>
<p>So, you know, uh the reasons for working are vast.</p>
<p>工作动机多种多样。</p>
<p>I think we get everything from folks that know that the P&amp; is a recognized employer and therefore um looks good on a college application, the the diversity of skill training from cash handling to guest services, the um the atmosphere of working with large um numbers of young people from across the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>有人看重P&amp;E的声誉有利于升学申请，也有人追求从收银到客服的多样化技能培训，或是与低陆平原各地青年共事的环境。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-126"></a></p>
<h3>00:44:50</h3>
<p>Um I think all of those things appeal and uh but we will see the P&amp; also and I'll just take a quick thing to say the P&amp; traditionally has had a view that we are a first job employer.</p>
<p>P&amp;E历来视自身为"首份工作"提供者。</p>
<p>We do not require previous experience to get experience.</p>
<p>不要求工作经验即可获得经验。</p>
<p>So that's always been a a large differentiator for us because so many people they go and they apply at a convenience store or at a fast food restaurant and they're told, "Well, you don't have any experience." And then they got caught in the cycle.</p>
<p>这与便利店或快餐店要求经验的模式形成鲜明对比。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-127"></a></p>
<h3>00:45:22</h3>
<p>The P&amp; as a not for-p profofit um has always taken the position that if you have a good attitude and a willingness to work, we'll find you a spot if possible and we will give you that first job training so you can go out and get that second job.</p>
<p>作为非营利机构，P&amp;E坚持为态度端正者提供首份工作培训。</p>
<p>M so yeah let me just take a call here Laura Laura Balance is my guest who is a spokes spokesperson for for the P&amp; the largest youth employer in the province and this as we look at a summer ahead where it may be harder for young people uh ages 15 to 24 to find work uh this generation um facing uh higher unemployment rates uh in decades and BC falls uh just behind Alberta when it comes to the worst unemployment rate in the country for young people.</p>
<p>劳拉·巴兰斯作为本省最大青年雇主P&amp;E的发言人，正与我们探讨15-24岁青年面临的数十年来最高失业率问题，BC省失业率全国第二高。</p>

<p>现在接入来自特雷斯的达尔文。</p>
<p>Hi Darwin, welcome.</p>
<p>你好达尔文，欢迎。</p>
<p>Hi, how are you today?</p>
<p>你好，今天怎么样？</p>
<p>I am fine.</p>
<p>我很好。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<h3>00:46:37</h3>
<p>What are you observing?</p>
<p>您观察到什么？</p>
<p>Um, just I' I've noticed it over the past several years with the international student boom.</p>
<p>近年来国际学生激增带来变化。</p>
<p>Um, my my partner, her uh her younger brother, he he had a friend that was working at Tim Hortons for for many years after school.</p>
<p>我伴侣的弟弟有位朋友曾在Tim Hortons兼职多年。</p>
<p>um he graduated recently and unfortunately they stopped scheduling his shifts.</p>
<p>毕业后却被停止排班。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-131"></a></p>
<h3>00:47:03</h3>
<p>Um with this international student boom, you're seeing some of these international students of course they need to make a living as well.</p>
<p>国际学生同样需要谋生。</p>
<p>So they are kind of more of these um entry level jobs per se like Tim Hortons, McDonald's um just and it kind of coincides with the same schedule as our youth, right?</p>
<p>他们占据了Tim Hortons、麦当劳等初级岗位，时间安排与本地青年冲突。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-132"></a></p>
<h3>00:47:25</h3>
<p>15 to 24, right?</p>
<p>15-24岁群体对吧？</p>
<p>They're either in school, so the after school hour shifts are being taken up now and then you have the summer the summer's off.</p>
<p>课后时段和暑期岗位被占据。</p>
<p>So, same thing, right?</p>
<p>情况类似。</p>
<p>The college is kind of the same schedule as our high school students.</p>
<p>高校与中学生时间重叠。</p>
<p>So, there's less availability due to a higher number of um candidates, I would say.</p>
<p>候选人增多导致机会减少。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-133"></a></p>
<h3>00:47:50</h3>
<p>Uh entry level.</p>
<p>初级岗位。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>for for those um those jobs.</p>
<p>那些工作。</p>
<p>And that is something that came up last summer as well as they looked at again a tight job market for young people.</p>
<p>去年夏季青年就业市场紧张时也出现这种情况。</p>
<p>And so, you know, as we know, this year the federal government uh plans to issue 10% less uh 10% fewer international study permits uh for international students.</p>
<p>今年联邦政府将国际学生许可减少10%。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-134"></a></p>
<h3>00:48:13</h3>
<p>And that's in the face of that kind of criticism when it comes to um pressure on uh healthare systems, on education systems, and on jobs.</p>
<p>这回应了对医疗、教育系统和就业压力的批评。</p>
<p>Um so Darwin you said that um uh that your uh partner's younger brother or the friend is now also is still looking for work now then yeah he's he's found um he's found a job with one of the local local restaurants in town fortunately uh just just a little small mom small mom small mom small mom small mom small mom small mom and pop pizza place and he's been doing pretty okay there.</p>
<p>达尔文提到，那位朋友最终在当地一家小型披萨店找到工作。</p>

<h3>00:48:48</h3>
<p>Yeah, it was it was unfortunate because he he did like they didn't actually let him go.</p>
<p>虽未被解雇，</p>
<p>They just kind of stopped scheduling him.</p>
<p>但停止排班。</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>确实。</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Right.</p>
<p>对的。</p>
<p>And oh boy, I learned a lot.</p>
<p>那段经历让我受益匪浅。</p>
<p>Um I worked there most of the summer and then um at the end of the summer my girlfriend and I joined it and traveled all over the east coast of Canada, it was a incredible experience.</p>
<p>嗯，我夏天大部分时间都在那里工作，然后在夏末，我和女朋友一起加入并游遍了加拿大东海岸，这是一次难以置信的经历。</p>
<p>Uh the other thing I'd like to add is that um as I'm pulling out weeds, I think in a young person that would like to garden, you know, in your neighborhood or someplace that looks overgrown or whatever.</p>
<p>呃，我想补充的另一件事是，嗯，当我拔草时，我在想一个喜欢园艺的年轻人，你知道的，在你的社区或某个看起来杂草丛生的地方。</p>

<p>Um Laura Balance um she talked there about the skills that she learned you know the the experiences.</p>
<p>嗯，劳拉·巴兰斯，嗯，她谈到了她学到的技能，你知道的，那些经历。</p>
<p>Um can you tell us more about what are the I I I know you said you don't need experience for for a job at the P&amp; but what are the things that you that you do look for when you are hiring?</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>I think it's um an enthusiasm, an excitement, a willingness to work as a team.</p>
<p>我认为是，嗯，热情，兴奋，愿意团队合作。</p>
<p>I think, and to your last caller's point, I think there is um a spirit of entrepreneurialism that has been inspired in young people that is likely at unprecedented levels.</p>

<p>And so in 2024, Canada did introduce uh changes to that temporary foreign worker program uh including a 10% cap on lowwage positions filled by uh TFWs in most sectors.</p>
<p>因此在2024年，加拿大确实对该临时外国工人计划进行了修改，呃，包括在大多数部门中，低薪职位由临时外国工人填补的上限为10%。</p>
<p>And that applies to the total number of low-wage positions uh being held by temporary foreign workers as a proportion of the overall uh workforce at a specific site.</p>

<h3>00:54:48</h3>
<p>Um what what can young people be thinking about in terms of making themselves more competitive uh perhaps not just for those entrylevel jobs but further along in their careers?</p>
<p>嗯，年轻人可以考虑什么来让自己更具竞争力，呃，也许不仅仅是那些入门级工作，还有他们职业生涯的进一步发展？</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>So I think uh you know when it comes to the case of the P&amp; I think showing your enthusiasm, showing your knowledge of of um in in this case the fair or the P&amp; or Hastings Park, showing your willingness to accept you might have applied for a guest experience job, but they maybe that department's full, but we have something in exhibit space and that willingness to be flexible to take on an opportunity in a different department.</p>
<p>所以我认为，呃，你知道的，在P&amp;的情况下，我认为展示你的热情，展示你对展会或P&amp;或黑斯廷斯公园的了解，展示你愿意接受你可能申请了客户体验工作，但那个部门可能已经满了，但我们在展览空间有职位，愿意灵活地在不同部门接受机会。</p>

<p>We have a large number of departments and I think in the case of the P&amp; we also have a lot of opportunity.</p>
<p>我们有大量部门，我认为在P&amp;的情况下，我们也有很多机会。</p>
<p>So you might may you know apply for a part-time job maybe you end up getting a seasonal job or a fairime job but often that'll turn into um you know a larger um opportunity and um maybe you might have to start in one area.</p>
<p>所以你可能会申请一份兼职工作，也许你最终得到一份季节性工作或展会工作，但这通常会变成，你知道的，更大的机会，嗯，也许你不得不从一个领域开始。</p>

<h3>00:55:47</h3>
<p>I'll tell you a little fun little uh trivia uh thing.</p>
<p>我告诉你一个有趣的小琐事。</p>
<p>many many years ago um a reporter was doing a story on kind of the best and the worst jobs at the P&amp; asked me he said what do you think is the best job at the P&amp; and I thought about it and I said probably prize home lottery vendor because they make a base salary plus commission so um a lot of our university students really want that job because they have the ability in in 15 days to earn quite a bit of money and I should say the P&amp; is a fully unionized site so all of our jobs actually start above minimum wage and uh and so we we do pay well um and have a lot of uh extra benefits and perks to employment there.</p>
<p>很多很多年前，嗯，一位记者在做一篇关于P&amp;最好和最差工作的报道时问我，他说你认为P&amp;最好的工作是什么，我想了想说可能是奖品房屋彩票销售员，因为他们有基本工资加佣金，所以很多大学生真的很想要那份工作，因为他们有能力在15天内赚到不少钱，我应该说P&amp;是一个完全工会化的场所，所以我们所有工作的起薪都高于最低工资，呃，所以我们确实支付得很好，嗯，并且有很多额外的福利和津贴。</p>

<p><a name="block-157"></a></p>
<h3>00:56:29</h3>
<p>But then the question was what's the worst job?</p>
<p>但问题是，最差的工作是什么？</p>
<p>And I said well I would think barn sweeper because you're cleaning up after the animals all day.</p>
<p>我说，嗯，我认为是谷仓清洁工，因为你整天都在清理动物粪便。</p>
<p>Fair.</p>
<p>公平。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>But let me check.</p>
<p>但让我核实一下。</p>
<p>So I actually went down to the barn and I started talking to a lot of the young people and what I found was the exact opposite that it is actually one of our most coveted positions particularly for urban youth who don't get the experience or the opportunity to be around um the animals like maybe um some of our more rural um uh uh employees do.</p>
<p>所以我实际上去了谷仓，开始和很多年轻人交谈，我发现完全相反，这实际上是我们最抢手的职位之一，特别是对于那些没有机会接触动物的城市青年，嗯，也许像我们一些更农村的员工那样。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-158"></a></p>
<h3>00:57:03</h3>
<p>And so they actually consider it and it's one of the most desirable jobs we have is to be a a barn worker because of that ability to be around the cows and the horses and all the other animals at the fair.</p>
<p>所以他们实际上认为这是我们最理想的工作之一，成为一名谷仓工人，因为有机会接触展会上的牛、马和其他所有动物。</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>Uh I I have enjoyed visiting uh that area, but I'm always glad that I when I'm about to go as well.</p>
<p>呃，我很喜欢参观那个区域，但我总是很高兴我要离开的时候也是。</p>

<h3>00:57:25</h3>
<p>But it's an interesting point because we were talking earlier about agriculture jobs um and what that means for young people.</p>
<p>但这是一个有趣的观点，因为我们早些时候谈到了农业工作，嗯，这对年轻人意味着什么。</p>
<p>It's it's it's another sector that young people tend to work in uh especially during the summer months.</p>
<p>这是另一个年轻人倾向于工作的行业，呃，特别是在夏季。</p>
