<li><a href="#block-2">00:00:27 You can feast on this question, what are the lesser known fo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-3">00:00:55 Well, last night, hours before it was to come into force in </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-4">00:01:17 Very simple.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-5">00:01:38 And it was a mistake for Canada to vow to implement that tax</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-6">00:02:01 Now the White House has confirmed trade negotiations between</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-7">00:02:25 We're making progress towards a final deal.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-8">00:02:45 So it provides some certainty.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-9">00:03:08 Now we want to hear from you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-10">00:03:36 Joining me now to talk about all of this is Max Cameron, pol</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-11">00:03:55 It feels like a big concession.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-12">00:04:16 Yes.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-13">00:04:32 They're much more powerful than we are.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-14">00:04:56 These are over five years.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-15">00:05:19 So this was a step in the direction of addressing that probl</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-16">00:05:46 They're not real trade agreements that are signed off by Con</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:06:09 If your Prime Minister Mark Carney, though, and you have a b</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:06:31 They approach trade agreements with irritants, and they use </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:06:51 Let's take a look at what comes out of those conversations.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:07:09 We've had 30 years of surrendering Canadians' sovereignty, f</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:07:31 And I, Karney has said that over and over again, that we nee</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:08:08 And in the meantime, building up our own capacity to develop</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:08:33 Love to hear from you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:08:56 You can also email BCTodayatcbc.ca and comment on our TikTok</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:09:22 What's the song?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:10:03 David, great to hear from you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:10:15 I looked at that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:10:42 Wasn't it, Matt, if you can, do you know, can you elaborate </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:10:59 They, because these platforms, many cases, are so important,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:11:23 And these are massive corporations that can certainly afford</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:11:52 So we need to somehow tax these foreign companies, so they d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:12:16 Hi, Ro Goodaf, Tune in.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:12:35 Now, the decision about rescinding the digital service tax, </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:12:56 So it's strategic to pause and negotiate.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:13:18 And that's where the government has to be really laser focus</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:13:40 He was talking about, you know, there's also the need to bol</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:14:09 Our troubles started well before President Trump returned to</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:14:32 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:15:02 But again, it's mostly on the provincial jurisdiction and th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:15:25 Max Cameron, your thoughts on how how Canada is doing when i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:15:52 He mentioned BLC 5 and that is a bill that's intended to mak</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:16:29 We're not always sure what exactly the plan is or the strate</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:16:54 And to that end, what do you think of what you heard from Ma</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:17:16 We got our elbows up as Canadians and voted for a government</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:17:39 So I think there's the strategy of Carney strikes me as bein</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:18:10 First, I believe there should be attacks on these mega compa</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:18:29 Most of us are coming to realize these mean absolutely nothi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:18:48 Hi Michelle.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:19:17 We have just handed over a very big card that we had.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:19:47 Oh, that's a very good question.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:20:10 And he can direct parliament.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:20:34 These are really not trade agreements.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:21:01 You put together a piece of legislation and then it has to p</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:21:26 And so that was the point that to your point about what happ</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:21:49 Thank you so much for your comments on TikTok.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:22:15 Hi, Doug.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:22:35 And it was that, you know, at the 11th hour, it was and it's</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:22:59 I'm obviously this is a you've heard the elbows down.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:23:18 Not only was it a good negotiating strategy as it was inheri</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:23:43 Really interesting point as well.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:24:11 You know what you were saying earlier about these negotiatio</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:24:30 We should work very closely with them on this and as many ot</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:24:51 The digital services tax was an easy giveaway by Carney beca</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:25:16 Really good to have you with us.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:25:35 I'm Michelle Elliott.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:25:53 That's coming up after the CBC News Update with Rob Zimmerma</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:26:20 RCMP and White Rock say a man has been arrested following re</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-69">00:27:08 Highs in the low 30s with lots of sunshine in the coot knees</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:27:32 Thank you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:28:07 Steven Smart is head of communications at YVR.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:28:26 Now, the staff in crunch has been going on for months.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:28:48 All those factors combined to put us in a situation now wher</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:29:10 The flight is currently operating as scheduled at the airpor</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:29:48 And how has food given you that connection and perhaps even </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:30:08 You can just leave your comment there.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:30:42 Welcome to both of you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:30:55 I mean, it happens in all different aspects of our lives.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:31:14 So it's very natural for us and chefs do you kind of embody </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:31:40 And you're both very active in the food community and in you</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:32:04 Sometimes it's a very male space and when you don't dominate</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:32:36 What made you want to be involved in that?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:33:07 So, do you feel that way that somebody lifted you up?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:33:31 Oh, well, yeah. In my family, of course, my mom and here, he</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:33:58 And I will say that it takes a village to do it because it c</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:34:25 Okay. It's really involved.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:34:45 You go layering with leaves.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:35:09 It's very calid also because we drink it with wine.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:35:34 Well, it's a family tradition every time that I go home, my </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:35:57 And what do you want people to know about it?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:36:17 We're taking your calls as well, asking you what is a lesser</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:36:45 So you can leave a comment there too.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:37:03 Oh yeah, I'm in my ramen era myself.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:37:27 What a beautiful email.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:37:53 So it's kind of like a Filipino Chinese dish.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:38:17 I tried to make it myself.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:38:36 You know, you unlock the core memory for myself because I ha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:38:59 And it's the same as like any other roast or stew in the rai</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:39:25 So it's like, it's just so easy for me to like go to somebod</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:39:53 Yeah. So much like I was saying that it created these things</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:40:19 But here they're going to have their own and they're going t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:40:51 How did it taste?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:41:15 And then you always have to come back and visit.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-105">00:42:09 Or going to try different restaurants.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:42:32 But there's all, I mean, I know Chinese foods, but tiny food</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:42:59 Like that's what I'm discovering now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:43:31 It was just a few years ago.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:43:53 I'd love to hear from you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:44:14 Ah, okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:44:28 So even here in the Japanese sushi restaurants and that they</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-112">00:44:56 And then on the side you have cucumbers, carrots, egg, and t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:45:26 And then you can mix the mustard into the liquid if you want</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:45:49 Love it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:45:57 I was thinking about soba, which are cold as well, but that </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:46:21 We do it in Chile and it has a lot of raspberry, so it's ver</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:46:38 What would you like to say?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:47:04 Oh, my goodness.</a></li>
