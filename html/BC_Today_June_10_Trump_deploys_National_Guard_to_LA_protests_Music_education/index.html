<li><a href="#block-20">00:09:17 The first three nights came on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:09:37 It's unclear how far it will go, but the big question right </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:09:52 The protests haven't spread to West Hollywood, Hollywood, We</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:10:09 This is being told to us by immigration advocates.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:10:24 Well, US President Donald Trump has now deployed more than 4</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:10:41 This morning, Trump defended his move to send troops in.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:10:57 Los Angeles right now would be on fire and we have it in gre</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:11:19 Also this morning, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Donald </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:11:39 I have no idea.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:11:55 So this was not needed.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:12:14 There was never an issue there because we were never thinkin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:12:28 You can call us and share your thoughts.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:12:48 Uh Terry lived in Los Angeles and did her PhD at UCLA.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:13:03 Well, the interesting thing about the protests, first of all</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:13:23 They go after people who are doing bad things.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:13:41 Um, so this is really going out.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:13:57 Although I have seen reports that people are being put into </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:14:33 You heard what Donald Trump said there, you know, that if he</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:14:50 Um, but the LA officials say, you know, we have it under con</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:15:07 Um, and so the, you know, basically the protests are happeni</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:15:36 They don't know what there's been no coordination in terms o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:15:54 And so jurisdiction is one of the key things that the federa</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:16:16 Yeah, apparently they're standing around federal buildings. </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:16:34 And so, you know, basically we've seen people protesting in </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:16:56 I I mean we've seen this in various protests. Um, you know, </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:17:40 Um can we talk about the National Guard and sending in Marin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:18:09 So that has definitely happened in the past. We have not see</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:18:58 Um and what are your thoughts? Love to hear from you. 1 800 </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:19:48 And so this is what we're trying to get to here um right is </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:20:33 And unfortunately, we've even seen a couple members of Congr</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:21:27 What could be the uh result or what impact does it have when</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:22:04 Uh so I think there is a political logic of trying to underm</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:23:00 And on that, California has filed suit uh to stop Donald Tru</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:23:55 And Randy writes from Burnaby, "I'm almost out of words, but</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:24:53 And as you say, um the the the cause or the reasoning before</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:25:37 And this idea of rendition as as we call it because it's not</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:26:31 And the other problem is that they're standing out people ar</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:27:15 And so it's almost entrament in many ways. And these are peo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:27:55 Nolan Marshall III is the executive director of the social d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:28:21 I I certainly haven't seen any reason for National Guards to</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:28:53 I think the presence of of National Guard has been uh a bit </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:29:13 Meg writes, "Uh, important to mention that it was proven tha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:29:40 He pardoned all the insurrectionists from the capital.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:29:59 Hi, Kasav.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:30:04 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:30:25 So why what is the need to give space to these events and th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:30:47 So yes, we can say Trump is overreacting, but there is no sp</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:31:12 Kav, thank you very much for the call.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:31:32 the the much of the violence started with uh really the the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:31:53 Um so a lot of the violence that you're seeing is not someth</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:32:07 We can handle this."</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:32:21 And you haven't even seen some of the things we saw, you kno</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:32:43 Um, you know, like I said, you know, we had the same we had </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:33:11 Jonas in Victoria.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:33:32 You just flip it around, right?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:33:50 Absolutely.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:34:06 There's something called the Posi Komaatus Act since the 170</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:34:22 We overlook the fact that this is nothing but First Amendmen</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:34:40 This is 1969.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:34:58 Why do we have to keep continuing to express ourselves like </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:35:16 And Terry Given, um, it's good good to have this conversatio</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:35:39 It's there's a lot going on and I agree that we need to not </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:35:56 It's 12:34 now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:36:20 The blaze is one of about 90 fires burning across the provin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:36:37 Health Minister Josie Osborne says government is searching f</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:36:55 Bus and handydart operators have been on strike since Februa</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:37:14 Highs around 18 with widespread smoke in the piece.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:37:31 And for Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, and the Fraser Va</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:37:50 Let's give you a quick update on those BC wildfires.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:38:08 The BC Wildfire Services there not in the clear yet, but tod</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:38:25 This broke out yesterday just east of the Sea to Sky Highway</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:38:47 Now, residents say the fire has been a wakeup call as the su</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:38:59 It's uh it's a little scary.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:39:15 It will be in place for 14 days unless the district or the p</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:40:01 So, we're asking you this half hour, how important is music </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:40:19 First we wanted to inspire you though.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:40:51 Hi everybody, my name is Andy Brit.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:41:14 This is the third tour where we made this in video game musi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:41:48 I actually did the very first symphonic video game music con</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:42:32 For me, the idea was that it was a great way to perpetuate t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:43:04 But now we have a whole new stuff that's coming.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:43:23 And this has now become part of of their pallet of music.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:44:12 So they're not just coming to hear symphonic key music conce</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:44:39 And perhaps that's the difference.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-104">00:45:01 So, they're becoming subscribers or they're at least coming </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-105">00:45:37 Siri also confirming that it has it was cutting its grade se</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:46:01 So that saves that program for this year.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:46:25 Good afternoon.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:46:40 At the same time, we're looking at some programs getting cut</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:47:00 And um it's it's so disheartening to see school districts pu</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:47:21 So if we believe in all those things, then then why are thes</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:47:42 Um and and really the um the issue here is that both of thos</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-112">00:48:02 So suddenly now we're not able to to continue funding this w</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:48:20 Um, and there certainly is truth to that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:48:42 Um, decisions that reflect their funding realities rather th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:49:08 Why do you think that is?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:49:33 So, they want to save money.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:49:55 So if you look at BC curriculum documents, you see arts educ</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:50:14 And so taking that away, uh in many schools ultimately takes</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-119">00:50:38 But you know saying band doesn't belong in the curriculum is</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-120">00:51:00 We have uh some calls and emails coming in to Allan writes f</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-121">00:51:18 Alan, thank you very much for your email.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-122">00:51:27 I you know I have to say I have been so so lucky to chaperon</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-123">00:51:53 I've actually sat next to a student on a bus who um part who</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-124">00:52:17 And so why all of a sudden when we we have this legacy of su</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-125">00:53:16 I am a parent in Siri school district.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-126">00:53:38 you know, it's uh band has such a lasting legacy and it's it</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-127">00:54:02 Angie, really good to hear from you. Thanks. Thanks very muc</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-128">00:54:17 Yeah. I'm a former arts educator in the District of Maple Ri</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-129">00:54:37 I'd like to know when specifically the fine art became some </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-130">00:55:10 And yet we have this 19th century approach from parents and </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-131">00:55:45 It is a huge employer, a very real career path.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-132">00:56:03 Shelley, thank you very much. Um, Charlene, our last caller </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:56:19 uh just informally and have read so much on the development </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-134">00:56:42 And I I believe it's just a primary um it's a primary human </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-135">00:57:00 And you know when I I remember being a teenager being very d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-136">00:57:16 I thought that was a good point the person made about it's a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-137">00:57:39 What would be the biggest um benefit of music education in y</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-138">00:58:00 And so the cognitive um benefits from learning music are are</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-139">00:58:15 The whole point of music education is to teach them how to b</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-140">00:58:28 and and if that's not happening in our public schools, then </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-141">00:58:52 So 3,000 this year and 3,000 next year and the following yea</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-142">00:59:06 Okay, we will continue to have this conversation obviously u</a></li>

<p>Well, the interesting thing about the protests, first of all, is that they were basically incited by ICE and President Trump because in past raids, you know, it's not unusual for there to be immigration raids.</p>
<p>首先，抗议活动的有趣之处在于，它们基本上是由ICE和特朗普总统煽动的，因为在过去的突袭中，移民突袭并不罕见。</p>
<p>Um, but typically they are going after and even Trump has said they go after criminals.</p>
<p>但通常他们针对的是罪犯，甚至特朗普也说过他们针对的是罪犯。</p>

<p>And so jurisdiction is one of the key things that the federal government is ignoring here. And it's complicating the situation for local law enforcement because they don't know what to do with these troops as we heard from the mayor there.</p>

<p>I I mean we've seen this in various protests.

<p>Um can we talk about the National Guard and sending in Marines? So how unusual is it for a president to do so without that request from the state? It's not supposed to happen this way.</p>
<p>派遣国民警卫队和海军陆战队有多不寻常？总统未经州政府请求就这样做是不符合程序的。</p>
<p>Um so the the way this has happened in the past for sure because there have been situations for example President Lyndon Johnson sent in the national basically federalized the national guard to go in and protect uh uh people who are protesting and fighting for civil rights in the south.</p>

<p>So that has definitely happened in the past. We have not seen this happen in a situation where a city is trying to deal with protests um in in this particular kind of way basically protesting what's going on u you know actions being taken by the federal government in this instance and so this is very it's people are up in arms uh my my friends who are legal scholars are up in arms because this is you know somewhat unprecedented uh that word keeps coming up and you know it it's typically As Governor Gavin Newsome has pointed out, there's process for this and those processes have been ignored.</p>

<p>Uh and here's an email about uh the the information that is being um uh disseminated. Uh social media broadcast posts. Douglas writes, "I'm concerned about how the media, including CBC TV and websites repeatedly show a burning car or a small pile of garbage burning, even if it was from several days ago. This is sensationalism in its purest form. 90% of the protests are rather boring. People standing opposite police and shouting at them from a distance about leaving immigrants alone. Doug, thank you very much for that.</p>

<p>And so this is what we're trying to get to here um right is that um it can be a different view from on the ground uh at the protest. There can be different views given visuals that that tend to make the rounds and get highlighted.</p>
<p>我们想强调的是，现场抗议的实际情况和媒体突出报道的画面可能存在差异。</p>
<p>you know what um how important is it I guess or what how important is it that people get a more an accurate view of what is happening to understand the implications of sending in the national guard sending in the Marines it's very important I mean I saw visuals yesterday of people dancing um and you know being you know very peaceful very calm and so I think the part of the problem is you know we we run on adrenaline right so we want to see the things that get us going.</p>

<p>And unfortunately, we've even seen a couple members of Congress post pictures from years ago of burning police cars. There have been no police cars burned. Yes, there have and I will say, you know, there have been rocks and even bricks thrown at police cars, but there have not been any burnings of police cars.</p>
<p>不幸的是，甚至有国会议员发布多年前警车燃烧的照片，实际上近期并未发生警车被烧事件，只有投掷石块的行为。</p>
<p>You know, the there have been very few attacks on uh the police. Actually, you know, it's interesting to me because I'm close to San Francisco. hearing the news out of San Francisco and there actually have been a couple police officers who were injured uh during protests here uh in the Bay Area and so um you know I don't want to say that that those kinds of things aren't happening but the they're very limited and that the it seems that the goal of the current administration is to make it seem like you you know the fires in LA you know that was a huge catastrophe this is nothing like that so</p>

<p>What could be the uh result or what impact does it have when uh the president, you know, speaks to media this morning and defends the steps that he's taken by saying, you know, if we hadn't if I hadn't done what I'd done there, LA would be burning right now.

<p>特朗普今早对媒体说"如果我不干预，洛杉矶现在就会烧毁"，这种言论有政治逻辑，他在迎合支持者。</p>
<p>Um but you know in a sense I think he's also trying to inflame those who are you know those in California who are protest protesting. He's trying to undermine Gavin Newsome and other leaders like Karen Bass.</p>

<p>Uh so I think there is a political logic of trying to undermine um you know political leaders who he doesn't like for one thing. um but also to you know get more support from you know or or to show his own supporters that he is you know he's being the tough guy and going out there and you know using troops but to be honest I think this is something he's always wanted to do he you know during uh you know 2020 he had talked to his staff about sending out the troops and he's finally getting to do it because he's got you know basically advisers around him who aren't willing to say no.</p>
<p>这既有打击政敌的政治逻辑，也有向支持者展示强硬形象的目的，事实上他2020年就想派兵，现在终于得逞。</p>
<p>Um, and there's going to be legal ramifications for all of this. I mean, some are saying that, you know, he has, you know, because of the expansion of presidential powers that he may have the right to do this, but um certainly, you know, California is going to be stepping up and, you know, the leadership uh is going to go after him and say, "Hey, no, there there's processes that need to be followed."</p>
<p>这将引发法律后果，虽然总统权力扩大可能让他有权这样做，但加州将采取行动要求遵循正当程序。</p>

<p>And as you say, um the the the cause or the reasoning before that was people who they described as as criminals, but it seems to be a different um uh population being targeted now. That's right. And so, of course, the government has the right to, you know, if people are here as undocumented, um the government has the right to say you don't have the right to be here and you can be deported.</p>
<p>政府有权驱逐无证移民，但之前针对的是所谓"罪犯"，现在目标人群已不同。</p>
<p>Um but the you know the rhetoric has been around you know criminals. I mean you know some one of the more horrifying things we've seen is you know people who were deported to places like El Salvador but it goes beyond that. There was an attempt to ship uh people who were being deported to places like Darur and so on.</p>

<p>And this idea of rendition as as we call it because it's not when you are sending somebody to a country that is not their own that is not deportation that is basically your rendition to a place that uh they have no connections to. So that I just put that out there as kind of some of the underlying concerns that people have had with the way the immigration uh uh you know enforcement has been handled.</p>
<p>这种"移交"行为（将人送到非原籍国）引发担忧，这不是正常的驱逐。</p>
<p>Um you know we don't know what's going to happen to the people who are being detained now. Many of them are probably from uh you know Mexico and other parts of Latin America. Uh but you know you know clearly the government has a right to you know say hey you know you're not here here but properly. But the problem is um those people especially if they have declared asylum you know have a right to go through a process that of you know determining are they here uh you know legally or not.</p>

<p>And the other problem is that they're standing out people are going to their court hearings and being detained right outside of their court hearings. So people, you know, part of the problem that a lot of people are having with the current it's not so much the law itself, it's the implementation of the law.</p>
<p>更大的问题是ICE直接在法庭外拘留出席听证会的人，这更多是执法方式问题而非法律本身。</p>
<p>And so the way that, you know, the the ICE and and Trump are going about it is literally standing in in court outside of courtrooms and grabbing people, putting them in zip ties as they're stepping out of their court hearings. And I've even heard of situations where people were expected to have like a Zoom hearing. They're act asked to actually come into court and their case, you know, the judge, you know, dismisses their case and they're sent out and immediately uh put into detention.</p>
<p>ICE在法庭外直接抓人、使用束线带，甚至有人被要求线下出庭后立即被拘留。</p>

<p>So yes, we can say Trump is overreacting, but there is no space for these protests in a civilized society and why is the government, elected government giving space to these protests, creating an opportunity for Trump to show that he is so powerful.</p>
<p>所以是的，我们可以说特朗普反应过度，但在文明社会中这些抗议没有立足之地，为什么民选政府要给这些抗议空间，为特朗普展示他的强大创造机会。</p>
<p>So that's the question we are we not diverting from the core fact that there is no space for these events by addressing or focusing on Trump rather than the bigger issue at hand.</p>

<p>the the much of the violence started with uh really the the police to a certain extent um with the you know using of tear gas um rubber bullets etc.</p>

<p>Um, you know, like I said, you know, we had the same we had some issues with violence in in San Francisco the, you know, the last couple of nights and the police handled it and even though some of them got injured, which is unfortunate, but these things happen in societies where people, you know, feel that their rights are being abridged and uh, but also there are just some people who, you know, when given the opportunity will shift towards violence and we just have to handle it and manage that.</p>

<p>I actually did the very first symphonic video game music concert in the western world all the way back in 2003 with the Czech national symph orchestral vontas and you know back then nobody had and I remember in that first rehearsal walking to the first rehearsal all the musicians were like we doing here what is gay music and kind of looking around at each other but when we got to the concert hall so the block house and generally um it was sold And the audience was kind of going crazy.</p>
<p>2003年，我与捷克国家交响乐团举办了西方首场电子游戏交响音乐会——记得首次排练时，乐手们面面相觑："我们在演奏什么？"但音乐会场场爆满，观众反响狂热。</p>

<p>For me, the idea was that it was a great way to perpetuate the life of the park by bringing in what I thought would be eyewear ago.</p>
<p>我认为这是通过新颖形式延续音乐厅活力的绝佳方式。</p>
<p>So at that time know we had 18y olds and 19 year olds and 20 year olds coming into the concert hall in t-shirt and jeans and it was kind of a revolution because the concert hall was typically filled with people with you know slightly gray hair in their gear except lovers of minced Beethoven.</p>

<p>And this has now become part of of their pallet of music.</p>
<p>这已成为他们音乐品味的一部分。</p>
<p>So, I think that's been sort of the primary impetus for me is to help to foster this new hobbies to listen to work.</p>
<p>因此，我的主要动力是培养这种新型音乐欣赏习惯。</p>
<p>For me know when I visit Norish girl back orchestra I typically tend to see the younger side of an orchestra audience because of the repertoire they're on program but I think in general that the orchestras that are open the Vancouver symph and and welcoming this new are seeing a younger audience but I think there's another distinction here and that is we're seeing an audience whose pallet of music is really diverse and really open.</p>
<p>像温哥华交响乐团这样拥抱新形式的乐团，确实吸引了更年轻的观众——但更特别的是，这些观众的音乐品味极其多元开放。</p>

<p>So they're not just coming to hear symphonic key music concerts, but they're going out to pop concerts, they're listening to hip-hop, they're listening to jazz, they're because of the accessibility of music.</p>

<p>At the same time, we're looking at some programs getting cut due to uh budget constraints.</p>
<p>另一方面却因预算限制削减课程。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>And um it's it's so disheartening to see school districts putting music programs on their chopping blocks.</p>
<p>看到学区将音乐课程列入削减名单，令人沮丧。</p>
<p>And we can, you know, speak to this from a perspective of all the benefits of music education.</p>

<p>So if we believe in all those things, then then why are these programs dispensable in our public schools?</p>
<p>既然认同这些价值，为何公立学校的音乐课程却被视为可有可无？</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>嗯。</p>

<p>Um and and really the um the issue here is that both of those districts have been longstanding models of music education, quality music education um in their schools.</p>
<p>问题在于，这两个学区本是优质音乐教育的典范。</p>

<p>So suddenly now we're not able to to continue funding this which is is distressing.</p>
<p>突然中断资助令人痛心。</p>
<p>Um the representatives from school districts will tell you that this is part of a much larger challenge rooted in chronic underfunding of K to2 public education across BC.</p>
<p>学区代表会解释，这源于BC省K-12公立教育长期资金不足。</p>

<p>Um, and there certainly is truth to that.</p>
<p>这确实存在。</p>
<p>And, uh, I think those of us in the education field can agree that music, not just music education, but K to2 education is underfunded in our province.</p>
<p>教育界同仁都认同，本省基础教育资金不足。</p>
<p>Um, and so this systemic issue then of underfunding is placing school districts in a position where they're having to make impossible decisions.</p>

<p>尽管资金不足是事实，但更需质疑：为何音乐课程总是首当其冲？</p>

<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>您认为原因何在？</p>
<p>Well, I one one myth that I've heard, especially in the last uh several years in BC since the new curriculum came out, um is that when when financial times are tough, we're starting to see school districts, especially Siri, especially in the last few weeks, adjusting language to support their purpose.</p>
<p>近年来BC省新课改后出现一种误解：财政紧张时，学区（如素里）会调整说辞来合理化削减。</p>

<p>So, they want to save money.</p>
<p>他们想节省开支。</p>
<p>They see um the grade seven band program as a viable solution.</p>
<p>将七年级乐队课程视为可行方案。</p>
<p>Um and so there is this myth that band specifically is not part of the BC curriculum or that band is extracurricular and that could not be more false.</p>
<p>有种谬误认为乐队课程不属于BC课程大纲，或属于课外活动——这完全错误。</p>
<p>Uh band is a valid curriculum aligned way to deliver the arts education curriculum.</p>
<p>乐队课程是符合艺术教育大纲的有效教学形式。</p>

<p>So if you look at BC curriculum documents, you see arts education, fine arts as the um as the the subject that needs to be taught.</p>
<p>BC课程文件明确将艺术教育列为必修科目。</p>
<p>And in many schools, uh band is the exclusive vehicle, the medium uh through which that curriculum is delivered.</p>
<p>许多学校仅通过乐队课程实现该教学目标。</p>
<p>So band is the delivery model.</p>
<p>乐队是教学载体。</p>

<p>And so taking that away, uh in many schools ultimately takes away all of the music education that those students are getting in these elementary schools.</p>
<p>取消乐队课，等于剥夺这些小学的全部音乐教育。</p>
<p>Um so with the uh flexibility in the BC curriculum so that it's designed to have you know lots of teacher autonomy in place and opportunities for schools and teach educators to make decisions on on how they want to teach the content and what they want to teach.</p>
<p>BC课程设计赋予教师自主权，允许灵活选择教学内容与方法。</p>

<p>But you know saying band doesn't belong in the curriculum is kind of like saying that you you can't use volleyball to teach team sports in PE.</p>
<p>但否定乐队课的课程地位，就像禁止用排球教体育团队合作一样荒谬。</p>
<p>And so when you look at the arts education curriculum document, it really does specifically talk about uh the valuable effects of ensemble based music learning and the way that we're doing that in our public schools is band.</p>

<p>And so why all of a sudden when we we have this legacy of success that starts with this 60-year history of band in Suriri schools um and of course across the province band in many schools um and that leading to success in the music industry, success in the arts industry um success in music therapy industry um why are we all of a sudden taking away that essential uh early education and um you know it's my understanding that there have been models presented to keep band seven in in Suri particular and I'm sure in Burnaby and uh other school districts and I've seen really creative solutions come through uh some districts where band has been cut and they've been able to sustain the the program and um I'm concerned that uh there's not enough eye being given to all of these uh models of delivery.</p>
<p>那么，为什么突然之间，当我们拥有这段始于Suriri学校60年乐队历史的成功传承，当然还有全省许多学校的乐队，并由此带来音乐行业、艺术行业和音乐治疗行业的成功时，我们却突然要取消这种重要的早期教育？据我所知，已经有一些模式被提出，特别是在Suriri保留七年级乐队，我相信在Burnaby和其他学区也是如此。我看到一些学区在乐队被削减后，通过非常创新的解决方案维持了项目。我担心这些教学模式没有得到足够的关注。</p>

<p>I thought that was a good point the person made about it's also uh you know, lots of employment in music, but it's it's deeper than that.</p>
<p>我觉得那个人说得很对，音乐还提供了很多就业机会，但它比那更深层次。</p>
<p>It's a a fundamental human um treasure.</p>
<p>它是一种基本的人类宝藏。</p>

<p>What would be the biggest um benefit of music education in your view?</p>
<p>在你看来，音乐教育的最大好处是什么？</p>
<p>Well and all this is articulated so beautifully. So not not to repeat what the caller said but you know we have local data sets.</p>
<p>嗯，这一切都表达得非常美好。所以不重复来电者的话，但我们有本地数据集。</p>
<p>There's a researcher at UBC Peter Gazuisus uh who has conducted research using local data sets that show that music actually changes the brain.</p>
<p>UBC的Peter Gazuisus研究员利用本地数据集进行了研究，表明音乐实际上会改变大脑。</p>

<p>And so the cognitive um benefits from learning music are are huge and they're locally documented.</p>
<p>因此，学习音乐的认知益处是巨大的，并且有本地记录。</p>
<p>Uh so that that one I think is big for me.</p>
<p>嗯，所以这一点对我来说很重要。</p>
<p>The other big point is that um we we are not attempting to create a bunch of professional musicians out of students.</p>
<p>另一个重点是，我们并不是试图将学生培养成一群专业音乐家。</p>

<p>The whole point of music education is to teach them how to be human.</p>
<p>音乐教育的全部意义在于教会他们如何做人。</p>
<p>Um how teach them how to function in society.</p>
<p>嗯，教会他们如何在社会中发挥作用。</p>

<p>and and if that's not happening in our public schools, then where is it happening?</p>
<p>如果这不在我们的公立学校中发生，那么它会在哪里发生？</p>
<p>Um I would also draw some attention to the fact that um you know every year if we want to look at some data in Suriri, there are 83,000 kids in the Suriri school district approximately 3,000 of them are directly affected by these um these ele cuts and that's each year.</p>
<p>嗯，我还想提请注意，每年如果我们看看Suriri的一些数据，Suriri学区有83,000名孩子，其中大约3,000名直接受到这些削减的影响，而且每年如此。</p>

<p>So 3,000 this year and 3,000 next year and the following year and the following year.</p>
<p>所以今年3,000名，明年3,000名，后年3,000名，以此类推。</p>
<p>this only costs $900,000 to deliver the program and so it's really it's just so shortsighted.</p>
<p>这个项目只需要90万美元就能运行，所以这真的非常短视。</p>
<p>Um yeah, so there's no doubt about the value.</p>
<p>嗯，是的，所以它的价值毋庸置疑。</p>
