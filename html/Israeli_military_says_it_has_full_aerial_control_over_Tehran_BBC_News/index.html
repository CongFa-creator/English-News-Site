<h1>Israeli military says it has 'full aerial control over Tehran' | BBC News</h1>
<p>【以色列军方称已完全掌控伊朗首都上空 | BBC新闻】</p>
<p>Summary:
The Israel-Iran conflict has entered its fourth day, with both sides continuing to exchange fire. Israel claimed it has gained full control of Tehran's airspace following Iran’s overnight missile strikes and warned residents of Tehran that they would face consequences—though it later clarified it had no intention of harming civilians. Casualties on both sides continue to rise. Iran has called on European nations to intervene and stop what it described as Israeli aggression. The Israeli military announced that it had killed four senior Iranian officials in airstrikes and had achieved complete air superiority over Tehran. The situation is evolving rapidly, prompting widespread panic and civilian evacuations. Satellite imagery shows damage to Iranian military and nuclear facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency has warned that the escalating conflict could pose a radiation risk. Experts predict the fighting may last for several weeks, with the United States seen as the only potential mediator.</p>
<p>摘要：
以伊冲突进入第四天，双方持续交火。以色列称在伊朗夜间导弹袭击后已完全掌控提兰领空，并警告德黑兰居民将付出代价，随后澄清无意伤害平民。双方伤亡持续上升，伊朗呼吁欧洲制止以色列侵略。以军宣布通过空袭击杀四名伊朗高官，并取得德黑兰领空完全控制权。冲突动态迅速，民众恐慌逃离，卫星图像显示伊朗军事及核设施受损，国际原子能机构警告局势升级可能引发辐射风险。专家分析此战或持续数周，美国被视为唯一可能调停方。</p>

<p>Uh obviously Israel has a very sophisticated layer of protection and now they're saying that this system is not perfect.</p>
<p>以色列虽拥有精密防护体系，但民众意识到其并非完美。</p>
<p>I mean, I think the strategy here, the Iranian strategy is to fire dozens, if not hundreds of missiles and drones at the same time trying to overwhelm the country's air defense system.</p>
<p>伊朗策略是同时发射数十甚至数百枚导弹和无人机以饱和防空系统。</p>

<p>It's it's all clear Israel seems to have that policy by weakening Iranian security forces domestically paved the way and create an environment for Iranian people who are not happy with the situation in Iran with economic situation with inflation and many frankly call this war it is the regime wars not their wars that's why I think trying to trying to create that that momentum for Iranian people to rise up but the defense Minister Mr. Katz very clearly yesterday said Iranian teran civilian could be a target certainly it's not in line with with what prime minister has been saying in the past two days just briefly we've seen people trying to leave Thran big traffic jams what do people know what kind of information are they getting there inside Iran about what is unfolding what is happening well Israel has been warning people leave civil leave area which is close to military and secret facilities.</p>
<p>以色列政策显然是通过削弱伊朗安全力量，为不满经济现状的民众创造反抗环境。但防长卡茨昨日称德黑兰平民可能成为目标，这与总理表态矛盾。德黑兰出现民众逃离导致的交通拥堵——伊朗民众对局势了解有限，以方虽警告民众远离军事设施，但许多秘密基地位置不为民众所知。</p>
<p>But the problem is many Iranian people in Thran they have no clue where those facilities where those bases factories are based because many of them are secret built places nobody knows about it.</p>
