<li><a href="#block-2">00:00:19 We're also going to be joined by Sioves Argelan from BBC Per</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-3">00:00:36 Let me begin uh with you Lee.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-4">00:00:59 There have been many decades of heightened tension, but neve</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-5">00:01:17 But this certainly puts this this tension into a whole new i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-6">00:01:34 We it is a war of words as well as an escalating war on the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-7">00:01:55 He's also used what the Iranians call strategic patience, pl</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-8">00:02:15 Do you think that is a parallel or do you think this is a ve</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-9">00:02:44 And that has, of course, utterly changed.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-10">00:03:09 They'll be nervous that that such a big change can happen so</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-11">00:03:35 Uh and secondly, that they negotiate an end to it willingly </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-12">00:03:55 Did we learn anything specifically new from that?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-13">00:04:34 uh we don't know what was in there before they were struck.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-14">00:04:52 So um yes, definitely some interesting sound bites from the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-15">00:05:04 Uh I just sort of want to build that out a little bit on wha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-16">00:05:18 Force protection basically means measures put in place to pr</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:06:00 So when the joint chiefs is talking about force protection, </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:06:18 Um that doesn't have much force protection.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:06:31 So I think that's an interesting piece in terms of risk espe</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:06:45 That's the that's the eyes and ears if you like over the Mid</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:07:04 A very basic question in a way.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:07:42 Um and I think the the president and his team his national s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:07:58 Uh it's missile stocks have been depleted as well.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:08:16 So there's sort of forms of asymmetric warfare that they cou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:08:33 And interestingly at that point in time, bear in mind, there</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:08:53 Um, but everyone is waiting here to see what the response wi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:09:11 Uh Donald Trump cares about public opinion and he cares abou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:09:30 Okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:09:46 And I just wondered where you you think we are.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:10:27 And for the US to get its hands dirty, to start dropping bom</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:10:48 Uh it doesn't have the kind of abilities that often people a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:11:12 Iran is not the kind of power that is able to to do that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:11:36 This is not a a major kind of attack, but it's the kind of t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:11:58 But nevertheless, this is a a considerable upgrading of it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:12:15 How many will not return to their families today?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:12:34 Uh many many more injured.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:12:49 Uh there had been reports earlier they would be taking prote</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:13:03 And Mark Lowen, a question um from VTO Fume in Italy who say</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:13:20 But the the alliance between the US and Israel goes back dec</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:13:46 Uh it was really showing the strain with um uh with a real k</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:14:08 Then in came Donald Trump who Benjamin Netanyahu has called </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:14:25 something which the Palestinians dispute.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:14:42 The big prize is Saudi Arabia which has said it will only ge</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:15:28 Yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:15:44 They have both put out statements condemning the attack by t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:16:07 If you recall, uh, Russia of course has been not so much now</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:16:36 uh he advised Iran to carry on talking with President Trump.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:17:01 That is really important because it shows I think that he st</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:17:26 distance themselves to some extent from from Russia over its</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:17:58 Okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:18:16 Yeah, I mean I think you've got you've got two potential opt</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:18:35 Basically, when the warhead separates from the rocket itself</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:18:52 Um so you've got those sort of that conventional response an</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:19:10 It had Bashar al-Assad's forces prior to his toppling.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:19:29 So a number of different courses of action that I'm sure um </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:19:49 Do we know h where it is or how we stop it falling it into t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:20:06 Yes, he was very much asked, in fact, right from the get-go </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:20:26 Even though the in the Israeli attacks of the last uh 10 day</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:20:43 It's still thousands strong.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:21:21 But for now, regime change is not on the agenda.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:21:53 But we heard um some clear uh updates from the US in that br</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:22:13 The internet's been down.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:22:39 So, a lot of concerns from Iran's point of view about their </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:23:01 So they're weak economically and that has had a huge impact </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:23:21 They called crack they cause cracks of course in the structu</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:23:42 So, the regime is weakened.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:24:02 There's no sign of that yet.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:24:28 But when you ask officials about that, they talk about resis</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:24:45 And and John Simpson just bringing you in there.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:25:00 Well, he's been putting out statements certainly.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:25:32 So there's no natural sort of opposition group uh that can j</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:26:00 there is no strong alternative.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:26:28 Okay, John Simpson, thank you very much indeed.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:26:50 Is it known even privately, discreetly how much there has be</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:27:18 uh those are the countries I know about.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:28:18 It's not always worked terribly well in South America and el</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:28:38 We're not coming after you for the time being.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:28:58 You know, the break up of the Soviet Union 45 years after th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:29:33 There are Persians but there are Arabs and there are Zeris a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:29:51 and Mark Lohen, uh, in Israel, what does that mean there tha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:30:08 Yeah, I mean, a poll came out about 3 days ago, Gita, showin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:30:31 But uh even though they support basically crushing the Irani</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:30:59 I mean a couple of points to make here.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:31:18 And so I think even though he is, you know, presenting himse</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:31:39 And you know, as John was alluding to, there are, as Gary wa</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:32:00 has been pursuing the war in Gaza uh with more than 55,000 p</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:32:28 Fine, but what comes next?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:32:41 And just a couple of questions, Mikey K, our security uh exp</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:33:04 Um, yeah, a lot to unpack in that question.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:33:21 Um I think the big unknown is uh Iran's ballistic missile ca</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:33:47 So I think that's going to certainly be a big question is ho</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:34:07 So it gets its engines from North Korea for example and it g</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:34:19 Um and then it goes back to so that's sort of more of a conv</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:35:00 I was I was stationed out there in the uh in the late '9s.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:35:15 They've been doing that for a long time.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:35:29 The UK government is saying it's there to try and identify w</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:35:45 That paints the picture in the Middle East.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:36:06 Typically, the public opinion in Iran is very divided, as it</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:36:27 And then you have the second group of people, people who are</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:37:00 And then you have another group of people in Iran and also r</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:37:28 Uh the opposition groups are hoping that these attacks can s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:38:09 Well, if we want to be completely objective, you know, it's </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:38:25 I think that's the center of attention.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-104">00:39:04 Even before the US attacks, Iranians said that they have mov</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-105">00:39:22 So um whether Iran can rebuild, how long it will take to reb</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:40:01 Um and let me bring in John Simpson to with a with a wider q</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:40:21 Well, you know, uh, if this was July 1914, I suspect a lot o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:40:54 The fact is uh that Russia is clearly very very nervous abou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:41:16 doesn't look in the slightest as though Vladimir Putin would</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:41:44 Um and therefore you can trust I think uh Vladimir Putin to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:42:11 But I don't think we're facing a nuclear war.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-112">00:42:31 Because obviously we also have the Gulf States.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:42:56 It will not do anything that might risk uh some kind of of u</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:43:22 So whatever China does will always be directed against any k</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:43:51 perhaps never will be, but that's what s that's what Saudi A</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:44:19 Israel can live with that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:45:02 Well, it's noteworthy that Iran has been a member of MPT, ha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:45:36 Um, I think one of the reasons why the international communi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-119">00:46:00 It has not recognized Israel as a state.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-120">00:46:26 And that's why I think is you know the argument that Iran in</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-121">00:46:54 there wouldn't be any kind of retaliation that would take th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-122">00:47:21 So that's one way for Iran to respond.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-123">00:47:48 Uh that's one of the thing Iran can do and also as a last re</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-124">00:48:07 and Gary Ojon who just very briefly we've only got a few min</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-125">00:48:36 They will hope that last night uh dealt a significant blow.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-126">00:49:01 Uh some of them a little bit haphazard, some of them not so </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-127">00:49:25 So they I think will be trying to work the back channels in </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-128">00:49:40 And John Simpson, if I can just um bring you in just to sum </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-129">00:50:02 Well, I'd like to make two points about this.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-130">00:50:22 It's small time.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-131">00:50:48 And in one particular respect, I think uh it it's downhill f</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-132">00:51:14 And I think we'll find that his power will start to diminish</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:51:35 And thank you all for sending in your questions.</a></li>

<p><button onclick="playAt(325)">▶️</button> um you just spoke about we don't know what the courses of action are uh for Iran but that will be certainly in that list of contingency planning and force protection around those bases could involve um systems called THAAD which is terminal high alitude area defense they're basically interceptor missiles that can go quite high backed up by Patriot and then around bases you have uh what's called a close-in weapon system called fallank um and that basically is a in a defense mechanism that that is used to target unguided rockets or mortars or lighter projectiles.</p>
<p>你刚才提到我们不知道伊朗的行动方案，但这肯定在应急计划列表中。基地周围的部队保护可能涉及“萨德”系统（末段高空区域防御系统），它们基本上是拦截导弹，可以飞得很高，并由“爱国者”系统支持。此外，基地周围还有“密集阵”近防武器系统，这是一种防御机制，用于拦截非制导火箭弹、迫击炮弹或轻型抛射物。</p>

<p><button onclick="playAt(2868)">▶️</button> Uh that's one of the thing Iran can do and also as a last resort Iran can attempt to really destroy uh oil infrastructure in the region in those countries where US has military bases and I think that's one of the worst case scenarios that uh people are contemplating.</p>
<p>这是伊朗可采取的行动之一，作为最后手段，它还可能试图摧毁美国有军事基地的国家的石油基础设施，这是人们考虑的最坏情况之一。</p>

<p><button onclick="playAt(2887)">▶️</button> and Gary Ojon who just very briefly we've only got a few minutes left and I want to to leave the last word with John Simpson if I can but Gary um what are the US options now if there is not a negotiated settlement because uh we we've heard that this was a very focused operation and Trump is clearly hoping for some sort of deal still but that might not happen imminently.</p>
<p>加里·奥乔恩，时间所剩无几，我想最后让约翰·辛普森总结，但加里，如果没有谈判解决，美国现在有哪些选择？因为这是一次针对性行动，特朗普显然仍希望达成协议，但这可能不会很快实现。</p>
<p><button onclick="playAt(2911)">▶️</button> Yeah, I don't think there's they're very optimistic about that happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>是的，他们认为短期内不太可能。</p>

<p><button onclick="playAt(2920)">▶️</button> Uh their briefing this morning was very very short on any proof of that.</p>
<p>但今早的简报几乎没有提供证据。</p>
<p><button onclick="playAt(2925)">▶️</button> Lots and lots of rhetoric, but not a single image or picture or piece of evidence to to prove that.</p>
<p>大量 rhetoric，但没有任何图像或证据证明。</p>
<p><button onclick="playAt(2932)">▶️</button> The other thing I'd say is in terms of retaliation, don't forget there have been some foiled plots here which have been Iranianbacked in the United States.</p>
<p>另一点是，别忘了美国曾挫败一些伊朗支持的阴谋。</p>

<p>有些有些草率，有些则不然。</p>
<p><button onclick="playAt(2945)">▶️</button> So there are there are potential types of retaliation that could come very very close to home uh for the United States and that could be a real threat to to the regime because you know an attack on on the homeland on the home soil here however it get gets done uh would be a significant blow to the Trump regime.</p>

<p>第一，我们不应高估伊朗的实力或能力。</p>
