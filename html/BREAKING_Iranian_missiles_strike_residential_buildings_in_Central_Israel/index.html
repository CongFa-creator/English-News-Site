<li><a href="#block-16">00:04:32 But that first attack when we were live on Fox and you saw t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:05:09 They're using similar missiles as to your question that they</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:05:30 They can't shoot down all of this incoming fire.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:05:55 These missiles are so large and they have such a large warhe</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:06:19 Without giving away too much of the location, I will broadly</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:06:41 It's a residential area and it's an area that is now under d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:06:59 They are targeting residential areas.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:07:16 And we talked to his friend and he said he was pulled from t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:07:31 These are humans.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:07:45 And as you can see in the distance behind me, this is a very</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:08:00 There will be significant destruction to residential areas o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:08:19 But the Israelis tell us this was the price that they knew t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:08:35 It's a residential area and obviously you don't want to give</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:08:53 It's supposed to be a normal Monday morning for them.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:09:13 Have have you been able to speak to anyone other than the ma</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-33">00:10:00 And I don't even know that he noticed, but he was bleeding f</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:10:15 From what we understand, you can imagine the types of injuri</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:10:35 They do have a text message alert that goes out to people.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:10:59 So broadly they have about 10 minutes when they know missile</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:11:17 The issue is that when these attacks happen in the middle of</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:11:31 They were pulling bodies out of the rubble of this apartment</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:11:51 I've been to this area countless times.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:12:14 You can see right now they're taking a drone into the air to</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:12:29 Earlier in the day, we were at another site where first resp</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:12:45 And this is something that we often adhere to.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:13:11 And as we move forward here and I just want to just show you</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:13:30 Yaniv, if you'll come with me here, I just want to show you </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:13:45 This is a convenience store, a corner store.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:14:03 There are no military locations close to where we are.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:14:23 They'll try to gather as much information as they can from p</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:14:46 We're live to America.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:15:14 Are you worried that there could be people under the rubble?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:15:33 There are medics on the scene.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:15:50 And these are critical minutes because if people are injured</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:16:14 Right now there are people unaccounted for.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:16:29 And in the distance there are ambulances and they're waiting</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:16:42 You couldn't even see the buildings.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:17:11 You couldn't even fathom to explain and describe.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:17:29 They are worn completely thin doing this.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:17:47 They are using the army and first responder units in the arm</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:18:02 And they said, "No, we're in what's called Miloim, reserve d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:18:16 And they were at a site basically saying, "We never thought </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:18:31 And so the fact that they were called up and responding to s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:18:46 And Iranian officials earlier in the day, just yesterday, ta</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:19:01 And the reality is that these major population centers like </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:19:22 And I talked to a few people I know that live around here, a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:19:39 And again, as we get more light here, the scene is coming in</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:19:57 Trey, I don't know if you can if you're seeing what I'm seei</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:20:12 Yeah, of course.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:20:30 Yes.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:20:50 There are Okay, just one second.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:21:09 But again, you're going to see the tent that I talked about </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:21:33 And just stay with me here, Ashley, because we just need to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:21:50 Yes, these are medic teams.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:22:05 Ashley, we're going to stand right here.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:22:26 And uh just be mindful of some of these signs.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:22:47 But uh again, behind me in the distance, there are teams sti</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:23:05 Uh how many people, like I said, this is just what I'm seein</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:23:32 Um we understand that there are multiple impact scenes and s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:23:47 They're prepared for these scenarios.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:24:04 And before I show it to you, you need to stay one second.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:24:23 There's no sign, doesn't tell you the exact location, but uh</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:24:39 They are and you can see they're bringing in a generator the</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:24:56 But you asked earlier about something that I I'll give you t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:25:22 And so today we were at the scene and and there they were we</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:25:46 And so when we think about the what they go through, you kno</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:25:59 And the dog's name was June.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:26:18 And so when I we talk about what it's for, why these first r</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:26:33 Like you said, they have other jobs.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:26:46 Trey Inst, thank you so much for the work you're doing down </a></li>

<p>是的。</p>
<p>And that's part of what we're trying to do here is get a better picture of that.</p>
<p>这正是我们试图在这里做的部分工作——更全面地了解情况。</p>
<p>And, it's a bit of negotiation here with these first responders.</p>
<p>而且，与这些救援人员的沟通需要一些协商。</p>
<p>Of course, it's a very tense scene.</p>
<p>当然，这是一个非常紧张的场景。</p>
<p>But we when you move in these areas, their biggest concern is that there are buildings that could collapse.</p>
<p>但当你在这些区域移动时，他们最大的担忧是可能有建筑会倒塌。</p>

<p>You asked earlier about the first responders, Ashley, and to tell you about them.</p>
<p>你问及急救人员的情况。</p>
<p>They're they're people, most of them, who have day jobs in high-tech or they work in uh in bars or restaurants, and they have volunteered in many cases to to come into a reserve role during this war and and to help and do what they can.</p>

<p>And so today we were at the scene and and there they were were in a circle and they were were basically trying to keep their spirits high understanding that the work that they were about to do is some of the most horrific work that you could imagine taking people's loved ones from under the debris in the aftermath of a ballistic missile strike.</p>
<p>今天他们在现场围成一圈互相打气，明白即将从导弹袭击后的废墟中搜寻遇难者是极其艰难的任务。</p>

<p>And so when we think about the what they go through, you know, we we've seen a lot of this firsthand.</p>

<p>It's challenging to to process.</p>

<p>And so when I we talk about what it's for, why these first responders do what they do, that's why because they want to be in a situation where they can give back to their community and and ensure they can help in any way possible amid this war.</p>
