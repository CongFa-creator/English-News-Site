<li><a href="#block-128">00:46:16 Remind us what what trade did you get into and when?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-129">00:46:40 I feel that yes, I have made a little bit of change to the p</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-130">00:46:55 Um, ACE is uh the brainchild that happened when I moved to C</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-131">00:47:25 Um I started ACE with uh four students in my parents' garage</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-132">00:47:40 So four students and me in that table in a parent's garage t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:47:57 So 20,000 is what the college has taught over the last 20 ye</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-134">00:48:18 One thing has not changed is um the the standard or the norm</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-135">00:48:39 Oh yeah.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-136">00:48:52 Corey's on the line.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-137">00:49:09 Mhm.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-138">00:49:30 Oh okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-139">00:49:45 Um but trades are so important because we're building all of</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-140">00:50:07 That's okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-141">00:50:34 So, there was a couple of dudes that were First Nations and </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-142">00:51:03 Um, I am First Nations, but um, so but they uh I'm not Cory </a></li>

<p>the public uh quickly realized that there was a lot for them to and I'm sorry when I say the public I mean people playing in the city and in the region realized that the 2010 games were not just about trying to get up onto the ski hills and watch snowboarding or or or or luge or events uh but to actually uh engage with the world as they all arrived on our shores and I feel as though that we're better prepared for something like that to happen uh next year counselor and I do remember covering the games and and the leadup to that I probably worth acknowledging though that in that time we were also just climbing out of the great recession and there were a lot of concerns about affordability and other issues that we're dealing with now.</p>
<p>公众（指本地居民）才意识到冬奥会不仅是滑雪或雪橇比赛，更是与世界互动的机会。我认为明年我们会准备得更充分。</p>

<p>And my point my my point is if the city's going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars hosting a tournament for soccer world class, perhaps we should look at the Canada Soccer's long-term development pathway for youth and start building a few fields a year in the city of Vancouver, which would not cost $600 million.</p>
<p>我的观点是，如果城市要花费数亿美元举办世界级的足球赛事，也许我们应该看看加拿大足球的青少年长期发展路径，开始在温哥华每年建几个球场，这不会花费6亿美元。</p>

<p>Good afternoon, Dan, and good afternoon, Councelor Clawson.</p>
<p>下午好，Dan，下午好，议员Clawson。</p>
<p>Pleasure to talk with you both, gentlemen.</p>
<p>很高兴与你们两位交谈。</p>
<p>Um, I feel that Vancouver is um I I feel that they're not quite ready to host a tournament of this magnitude.</p>
<p>嗯，我觉得温哥华还没有完全准备好举办如此规模的赛事。</p>
<p>And I understand and I and I I I feel your sentiment, councelor Clawson, that you're saying about the kids, but um with the terrorists and everything, um you're not going to have the United people from the US coming to Canada to watch the let's say the United States is playing Canada.</p>
<p>我理解并感受到你的情绪，议员Clawson，你谈到了孩子们，但考虑到恐怖主义等问题，你不会有很多美国人来到加拿大观看比赛，比如美国对加拿大的比赛。</p>

<p>Now, you're not going to have many Americans coming up here because due to the fact or due to due to the um due to the tariffs and um you're not going to have many Canadians going down to the States to watch Canada's games and you're going to have a ton of Mexicans and I feel that with the homelessness problem, like why is why is the city of Vancouver and maybe you can touch on this councelor Clofflin, why is Vancouver um getting a tournament of this magnitude when we have a rampant homelessness problem and uh people that like and and I feel that with an event of this magnitude, you're going to need a whole bunch of security so there's not a there's not some clown ramming people with their vehicle.</p>
<p>现在，你不会有很多美国人来到这里，因为关税等原因，也不会有很多加拿大人去美国观看加拿大的比赛，而会有很多墨西哥人。我觉得，面对无家可归的问题，为什么温哥华要举办如此规模的赛事？议员Clofflin，也许你可以谈谈这一点。我觉得，举办如此规模的赛事，你需要大量的安保措施，以防止有人驾车冲撞人群。</p>

<p>Uh, all points well taken.</p>
<p>所有的观点都很有道理。</p>
<p>Um, so the city has always had challenges around homelessness and I think that that won't necessarily go away as a result of uh us hosting FIFA.</p>
<p>城市一直面临无家可归的挑战，我认为举办FIFA不会让这个问题消失。</p>
<p>uh but we have been able to host uh world uh global events like this in the past successfully and I think that um the the two can essentially coexist but I think we want to make sure that people feel safe and secure and that the people and residents of the city also feel as though that they can be a part of this as well.</p>
<p>但我们过去成功举办过类似的全球赛事，我认为两者可以共存，但我们希望确保人们感到安全，城市的居民也能感到他们是其中的一部分。</p>

<p>我还想指出他关于与美国邻居关系的观点。</p>
<p>It's actually quite interesting.</p>
<p>这实际上很有趣。</p>
<p>I was at the board of trade lunch where um the US council attended and spoke and um he and his staff were there as well have been really trying to work closely with local officials uh such as destination Vancouver and the border trade to make sure that that that border uh uh is not a barrier for travelers who want to go to games in Seattle and go to games in Vancouver whether they be Americans or Canadian Adians.</p>
<p>我参加了贸易委员会的午餐会，美国领事出席并发言，他和他的团队一直在与当地官员密切合作，如Destination Vancouver和边境贸易，以确保边境不会成为想去西雅图和温哥华观看比赛的游客的障碍，无论他们是美国人还是加拿大人。</p>

<p>So I think that that work is happening right now and uh there is a I I think a a sincere effort and an outreach by the US console to try and see the both the Seattle and Vancouver uh games as a part of a of an overall region, a Cascadia focus if you'd like.</p>
<p>因此，我认为这项工作正在进行中，美国领事真诚地努力将西雅图和温哥华的比赛视为整个地区的一部分，如果你愿意，可以称之为卡斯卡迪亚焦点。</p>

<p>Now, uh, Joseph, for people who aren't big sports fans, and just before we get to the break, can you put into context how big this event is?</p>
<p>约瑟夫，对于非体育迷，在进入广告前，你能说明这赛事有多盛大吗？</p>

<p>我亲自教授了大约5,000到7,000人，他们经历了获得认证的过程，包括红印章考试认证。</p>
<p>Those are my students and people who are in the trade who are getting their foreman license or the getting the electrical contractor's license going through this cycle.</p>

<p>Carpenters do make less by comparison to electricians, plumbers, boiler makers, welders, sheet metal.</p>
<p>木工工资确实低于电工、水管工、锅炉工、焊工和钣金工。</p>
<p>Um, and really for me what I've seen over my career is that wages have not kept up with inflation like everything else, but I think we've slipped a bit more and the we haven't had any basic improvements like you'd get in other careers if you went say and became an engineer or got a degree.</p>

Why would I make $25 an hour when I can make $20 at an easier job?</p>

<p>I've run my own business now.</p>
<p>现在自己经营生意。</p>
<p>Actually, on my uh my dad's side of the family, I'm one of two people out of about 30 grandkids that didn't get a university degree, but I probably make more money than the rest.</p>
<p>家族30个孙辈中只有2人没上大学，但我的收入可能最高。</p>
<p>And you remind them, don't you?</p>
<p>你经常提醒他们吧？</p>

<p>No, I try not to.</p>
<p>我尽量不提。</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>好吧。</p>
<p>But, um I uh I want to echo what that last guy was saying.</p>
<p>我同意上一位来电者的观点。</p>
<p>I actually went through became a red seal carpenter and uh to be honest I have never in 23 years been asked whether or not I have a red seal and uh the um temporary foreign worker program in Canada has just been one of the tools the government has used to just gut the industry.</p>
<p>我有红印章认证，但23年来没人问过——临时外劳计划摧毁了这个行业。</p>

<p>You actually get more workers rights working at McDonald's than you do in construction.</p>
<p>在麦当劳打工比建筑业更有权利保障。</p>
<p>If you go into the workers rights legislation, the construction industry has an exclusion for almost everything.</p>
<p>建筑业几乎不受劳动法保护。</p>
<p>Overtime pay, notice for being fired, reasons for being fired, not even required until our government and the schools that are providing training start working together to go, look, we have to fix this massive problem in the industry and what we've done to it over the last 35 years.</p>
<p>除非政府和培训机构合作解决这个问题，否则情况不会改变。</p>

<p>uh Canadians especially are not going to be getting into the trades.</p>
<p>加拿大人不会进入技工行业。</p>
<p>Uh and I mean if you're going to get into the trades, get into a technical trade, an electrician, a pipe fitter, a plumber.</p>
<p>如果要进入技工行业，建议选择电工、管道工等技术性工种。</p>
<p>Um great great industries.</p>
<p>这些行业很棒。</p>
<p>I love the industry, but the the challenge is like the last caller said, the the the industry just continues to be gutted for massive government projects and they continue to make rules and set exceptions.</p>
<p>但正如上一位所说，行业正因政府项目和政策而崩溃。</p>

<p>时间到了。</p>
<p>Uh, Sup Chavela, we really appreciate your time and your expertise.</p>
