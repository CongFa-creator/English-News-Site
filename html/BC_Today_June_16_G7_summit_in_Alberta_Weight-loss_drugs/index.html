<li><a href="#block-3">00:00:50 Dr. Ashe Jane will take your questions.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-4">00:01:19 G7 member nations include France, Germany, Japan, and the Un</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-5">00:01:33 The meetings are planned for between Monday and Tuesday.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-6">00:01:52 We will have open frank discussions over the course of uh th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-7">00:02:16 We're taking your calls now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-8">00:02:41 Heyish, thanks for joining us.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-9">00:03:00 Um he's a very volatile individual.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-10">00:03:16 And that was Justin Trudeau standing up for Canada on steel </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-11">00:03:32 And to that end, uh rather than um uh a more detailed sort o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-12">00:03:50 Well, it signals just the difficulty of having this summit.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-13">00:04:08 So they're looking for small wins here.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-14">00:04:20 But maybe not.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-15">00:04:37 And here's what they each had to say about the tariffs and t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-16">00:04:56 I'm a I'm a tariff person.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:05:12 So, we're going to look at both and we're going to see what </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:05:29 Okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:05:43 I mean, the they sound fairly different from how he talked a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:05:55 Mark Carney's a free trader.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:06:12 Uh so that is huge and it indicates that Donald Trump whatev</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:06:31 That that is something that certainly Canadians will be watc</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:06:53 So, asking you what you're watching for 1 800 825-5950604-66</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:07:16 When did Canada start letting criminals into Canada?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:07:32 Why aren't they arresting him and deporting him?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:07:55 Haish Telford, what what are the rules around that?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:08:19 Donald Trump of course travels as a very important person, a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:08:33 Jim, thank you very much.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:08:56 And uh the bottom line from those experts is that it would l</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:09:12 A question that many have asked though leading up to the G7.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:09:23 I'm just more looking into like investment opportunities wit</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:09:40 And I guess seeing what Trump would want to do for, you know</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:09:55 I mean, we got our dollar up 73 cents USD.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:10:04 Well, sorry.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:10:22 Yeah. Okay. We'll put that uh that question to our guests he</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:10:40 Canada wants tariffs lifted completely. Donald Trump says he</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:10:57 Um maybe um missile defense is something that Mark Carney sa</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:11:11 I think we're like Mark Carney has talked about an economic </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:11:29 Um now he's disrespected it. He hasn't even respected the de</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:11:54 Our email is BCT today at cbc.ca.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:12:12 um bombings now uh heading days later um continuing between </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:12:34 Of course, the G7 has no favor for Iran. We we view Iran as </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:12:58 So that's going to be a very very difficult thing to negotia</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:13:11 Both of these things, but this new escalation of of hostilit</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:13:34 Is this a place where there can be some kind of definitive s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:14:01 Um evidently the United States has already um vetoed Israel'</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:14:23 Uh he's expected to arrive later today in Canonascis.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:14:43 Um you know the the the question of of uh of uh the foreign </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:15:04 Uh this is a we've we've had very little cooperation from th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:15:26 We're in desperate need of new friends and uh China would be</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-51">00:15:48 So it's you know hence Mark Carney is really really reaching</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-52">00:16:22 So uh we now both have both countries now have a serious int</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-53">00:16:46 Of course, this is taking place uh as the ongoing trade war </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-54">00:17:04 Let's uh take some calls here.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-55">00:17:24 Oh, hi. Thank you very much for taking my call.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:18:21 It will be interesting to see if he, you know, makes a date,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-57">00:18:47 And I I don't know how. And the guy says he wants peace on d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-58">00:19:17 um and the protest starting in LA in downtown LA.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-59">00:19:47 Well, I really do think the G7 leader should be talking abou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-60">00:20:17 Migrants are fleeing persecution, economic turmoil, politica</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-61">00:20:41 What to you is the most urgent issue whether it's on the off</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-62">00:21:10 Can they actually talk about that with Donald Trump there an</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-63">00:21:31 Uh thank you very much. I imagine we'll talk to you again.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-64">00:21:49 It is about 12:27 now here on BC today.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-65">00:22:10 Mark Carney did not engage.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-66">00:22:28 But it didn't work out that way.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-67">00:22:44 It was a mistake in that you spend so much time talking abou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:23:04 How about uh the G7 countries uh get a spine and stop the ge</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-69">00:23:20 You can continue to send us more of your thoughts.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-70">00:24:13 Just search for the CBC British Columbia page.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:24:30 Uh what's been your experience?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:24:54 The man was reported missing last night at around 6:30.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:25:12 They say emergency crews responded at around 2:30 in the mor</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:25:28 And one person is dead and another is in hospital after a ve</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:25:45 And now the forecast on the north coast.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:26:02 Highs in the mid20s with some sunshine this afternoon.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:26:21 That's your CBC News update from Vancouver.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:26:34 I hope you had a great weekend.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:27:01 So, it was wonderful to see uh people coming to support and </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:27:16 I found out I was going to be a father when I was 18 back in</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:27:38 We're still together 27 years later and we are so proud of o</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:27:56 That is just lovely.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:28:10 That allows a parent to know what's going on and encourages </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:28:39 Uh they're known under name brands like Ompic.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:29:13 That is an ad by Ozmpic.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:29:30 Now these brands have flooded ads and social media.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:29:52 Our email as well is bctoday at cbc.ca.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:30:14 How much more interest are you seeing in these types of pres</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:30:40 Back even after a few years ago there was a lot of blaming a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:31:02 Whereas now we understand that obesity is a disease uh one t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:31:23 We know that the rates of diabetes unfortunately are going u</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:31:40 What about um the risks?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:32:09 So to that end we know that uh as far as side effects are co</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:32:31 So, for most people if they are able to stick out with this </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:33:08 That's right.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:33:31 Uh it's called N a n which is a form of neuropathy.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:33:52 So to give you actual numbers here the typical rate of this </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:34:14 We still don't understand why this condition happens in peop</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:35:04 So that's a potential benefit and also we know that diabetes</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:35:29 Dr. Ash Jane is with me and uh he's a uh clinical and resear</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:35:53 1 800 825-5950-604-6693733 or just hit pound690 on your cell</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:36:18 Other risk factors are being a woman and being over 40, all </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:36:37 I have a background in nutrition and health, so was able to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-104">00:36:51 I think patients should be recommended nutritional replaceme</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-105">00:37:07 I'll get you to touch on that, Dr. Jane.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:37:23 But having said that, when our appetite goes down, our prote</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:37:39 So it's very crucial that if someone is on this group of med</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:37:58 That's really interesting and and Jessica also writes about </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:38:30 Um the thing is our understanding of what an individual's ov</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:38:59 we really don't know.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:39:21 Okay, Jessica, thanks so much for sharing that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-112">00:39:31 I I I started taking about eight months ago and um I've I've</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:39:50 Um I've taken out.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:40:12 It started working for you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:40:28 Absolutely.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:40:45 And from an evolutionary perspective uh we are always inclin</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:41:06 That's part of self-preservation.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:41:29 So Michelle you know all of us have been in that position wh</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-119">00:42:02 So lack of additional weight loss doesn't mean failure of me</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-120">00:42:17 Thank you very much Elaine for your call.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-121">00:42:31 We do have an expert with us, Dr. Ash Jane, uh an endocrinol</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-122">00:42:55 Hi Kale, thanks so much for calling in.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-123">00:43:24 Looking at that as an avenue.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-124">00:43:45 Others it can be a change in metabolism that's leading to we</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-125">00:44:07 Um there are a lot of research trials going on in this field</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-126">00:44:25 Uh H writes a simple question.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-127">00:44:44 The challenge is that the rubber band example that I gave yo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-128">00:45:12 It may not be all the weight that they have lost.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-129">00:45:43 So actually there was a very big study that was just complet</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-130">00:46:18 So we're now entering this new era where we are finding that</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-131">00:46:37 It reduces the risk of heart failure which is basically when</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-132">00:46:59 Uh we're now seeing that some studies that take into account</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:47:28 So it's it's kind of like the gift that keeps giving because</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-134">00:47:48 But as far as all of these research studies that have been d</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-135">00:48:05 OT is calling us now from Victoria.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-136">00:48:21 Okay.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-137">00:49:00 Uh how often does that happen?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-138">00:49:17 It's completely against ethics.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-139">00:49:44 So the brand name ompic is approved for the management of ty</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-140">00:50:48 There are calls for that to be expanded.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-141">00:51:08 And unfortunately, we do treat or we have pharmarmacare cove</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-142">00:51:33 So I wholeheartedly agree with you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-143">00:51:53 And just to be clear, I have 20 seconds here.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-144">00:52:13 Thank you, Dr. Jane.</a></li>

<p>He um mentioned that uh Biden allowed 21 million illegal immigrants into through the border which are all murderers, rapists, etc. into our country which is very fabricated and propaganda on our soil and you know to start with um all I remember him saying initially was Canada has treated us very bad and I thought you know we were excellent neighbors to the US and now he's kind of hovering and threatening with all these tariffs.</p>
<p>他声称Biden放任2100万"罪犯"非法入境纯属捏造，此前还无端指责加拿大并威胁加征关税。</p>

<p>Well, I really do think the G7 leader should be talking about global migration generally.</p>
<p>G7应讨论全球移民问题。</p>
<p>This is a huge issue not just for the United States but for Canada uh for our European partners as well.</p>
<p>这对美加欧都是重大议题。</p>
<p>and and we cannot treat this at the back end, right?</p>
<p>不能仅事后处理。</p>
<p>You know, what what Donald Trump is trying to do, what many other countries are trying to do is sort of uh treat it after the immigrants or migrants have arrived rather than going down um and trying to stop the migrants from coming in the first place.</p>
<p>Trump等多国现行政策侧重入境后处置，而非源头管控。</p>

<p>So to that end we know that uh as far as side effects are concerned gastrointestinal side effects seem to be the most common.</p>
<p>因此我们知道，胃肠道副作用似乎最常见。</p>
<p>So, and this differs from person to person.</p>
<p>这因人而异。</p>
<p>Uh, but nausea is generally the commonest side effect seen in about 30% of individuals.</p>

<p>So, for most people if they are able to stick out with this medication then chances are that they will be able to overcome these side effects.</p>
<p>大多数人坚持用药就能克服这些副作用。</p>
<p>Other gastrointestinal side effects include diarrhea or constipation.</p>
<p>其他胃肠道副作用包括腹泻或便秘。</p>
<p>So these are generally the most common side effects and a good side effect uh is of course the weight loss which is what led to these medications then being studied in obesity and uh getting that uh label indication and there was some research out of the University of Toronto um that finds a link between these drugs and vision loss.</p>

<p>That's right.</p>
<p>没错。</p>
<p>So there's been uh quite a few research studies that have been done uh with some conflicting results.</p>
<p>已有不少研究，结果有些矛盾。</p>
<p>So when we look at uh visual um changes that happen on this class of medications uh we see that uh potentially there could be an increased risk of a very very rare condition.</p>

<p>Uh it's called N a n which is a form of neuropathy.</p>
<p>称为NAN，是一种神经病变。</p>
<p>Uh the nerves in the back of the eye can get affected.</p>
<p>眼后部神经可能受影响。</p>
<p>uh the risk can go up with this group of medications uh with simaglletide in particular is what the studies have shown but having said that the risk still remains extremely low as far as numbers are concerned.</p>
<p>研究表明西马鲁肽尤其可能增加风险，但风险仍极低。</p>

<p>So to give you actual numbers here the typical rate of this condition is 1 in 10,000 individuals uh seem to have this condition and uh on this medication the risk could be slightly higher two in 10,000 individuals.</p>
<p>具体数字是，通常发病率为万分之一，用药后可能略高至万分之二。</p>

<p>We still don't understand why this condition happens in people on this class of medications.</p>

<p>Uh recent studies also suggest another very rare um diabetic uh associated condition called macular degeneration.</p>
<p>最近研究还提示另一种极罕见糖尿病相关病症——黄斑变性。</p>
<p>the risk could go up on this class of medications but again the overall numbers are extremely small in in fraction of percentage points but if I had to extend that a little bit more Michelle um we are seeing that there's actually lots of benefits with these medications associated with vision as well so a very common condition called glaucoma um is seen in individuals uh which increases the pressure in the eye and we are seeing that this class of medications in uh research studies have shown that it reduces the pressure, reduces glaucoma.</p>
<p>这类药物可能增加风险，但绝对数字极小。实际上这类药物对视力也有益处，如研究显示可降低青光眼患者的眼压。</p>

<p>So that's a potential benefit and also we know that diabetes tends to make uh you know our vision worse and by controlling diabetes um we can help reduce the risk of bleeding in the back of the eyes.</p>

<p>I'll get you to touch on that, Dr. Jane.</p>
<p>Jane医生，请谈谈这点。</p>
<p>Yeah, I I couldn't agree more with Jessica.</p>
<p>我完全同意Jessica。</p>
<p>It's a really important observation.</p>
<p>她的观察很重要。</p>
<p>The thing is with this group of medications, it reduces hunger.</p>
<p>这类药物会减少饥饿感。</p>
<p>It reduces appetite.</p>
<p>降低食欲。</p>
<p>Um, and that's one of the reasons why weight loss occurs.</p>
<p>这是减肥的原因之一。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-106"></a></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UXNezkEJF/?t=2243" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:37:23</span></a></h3>
<p>But having said that, when our appetite goes down, our protein intake can also go down significantly.</p>
<p>但食欲下降时，蛋白质摄入也可能大幅减少。</p>
<p>And that's why some studies suggest that many individuals can develop some degree of muscle loss uh as part of the overall weight loss that people are experiencing.</p>
<p>因此研究显示，减肥可能导致肌肉流失。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>So it's very crucial that if someone is on this group of medications uh we pay close attention to what their protein intake is and also encourage physical activity because the more we activate those muscles there's a less chance of muscle loss.</p>
<p>所以用药期间需关注蛋白质摄入并鼓励运动，以减少肌肉流失。</p>

<p>能详细说说吗？</p>
<p>Yes. So this is a known uh phenomenon and this occurs with any kind of weight loss.</p>
<p>这是已知现象，任何减肥方式都可能引发。</p>
<p>Say for instance if somebody were to undergo beriatric surgery or weight reduction surgery um that can also precipitate uh gallstone or gallbladder related issues um as can sometimes crash diets which uh exacerbate the risk of these conditions.</p>

<p>Um the thing is our understanding of what an individual's overall uh response to these medications is still quite limited.</p>
<p>目前对药物反应的了解仍有限。</p>
<p>We don't know who's going to be what we call a super responder like someone like Jessica who's lost tons of weight.</p>
<p>无法预知谁会是“超级反应者”（如减重显著者）。</p>
<p>Uh someone who's an average responder where studies suggest that these medications help people lose about 15 to 20% of their body weight depending on other medical conditions and then others that are less than average responders.</p>
<p>普通反应者可能减重15-20%，而部分人效果更差。</p>

<p>we really don't know.</p>
<p>我们尚不确定。</p>
<p>So right now um we just evaluate medically if that person's a good candidate for using the medication and then monitor closely.</p>
<p>目前仅能评估用药适应性并密切监测。</p>
<p>So if someone is losing weight very rapidly, it might be a good idea to scale down the dose a bit uh and then see if we can potentially you know reduce that rapidity of weight loss that's happening.</p>
<p>若减重过快，可考虑降低剂量以减缓速度。</p>

<p>Elaine，信号不好，但听懂你的问题：你遇到了平台期。</p>

<p>It started working for you.</p>
<p>最初有效。</p>
<p>Um and it was a good alternative to what hadn't been working, but uh now it seems to have stopped working for you.</p>
<p>替代方案曾有效，但现在失效。</p>
<p>So what's next?</p>
<p>接下来怎么办？</p>
<p>Uh Elaine, thank you very much.</p>
<p>感谢来电。</p>
<p>Uh okay, we'll get Dr. Jane to address that.</p>
<p>请Jane医生解答。</p>
<p>Is that something that can happen is a sort of kind of this plateau?</p>
<p>平台期常见吗？</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UXNezkEJF/?t=2428" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:40:28</span></a></h3>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>当然。</p>
<p>It's it's a very common phenomenon.</p>
<p>非常普遍。</p>
<p>So the the way our caveman part of the brain works which is uh basically the you know just like we have a thermostat in our rooms to moni to regulate the temperature.</p>
<p>大脑像恒温器一样调节体重。</p>
<p>We have a thermostat in our brain that regulates our body weight.</p>
<p>这是进化本能。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UXNezkEJF/?t=2445" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:40:45</span></a></h3>
<p>And from an evolutionary perspective uh we are always inclined to self-preservation.</p>
<p>出于自我保护。</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>对吧？</p>
<p>We want to do anything that we can to maintain um our our overall um day-to-day living activity.</p>
<p>身体会竭力维持现状。</p>
<p>So when we start having significant weight loss, uh that's when sooner or later the body will apply brakes.</p>
<p>显著减重后，身体会“刹车”。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-117"></a></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UXNezkEJF/?t=2466" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:41:06</span></a></h3>
<p>That's part of self-preservation.</p>
<p>这是自我保护机制。</p>
<p>That's the way the the thermostat in the brain works.</p>
<p>大脑恒温器的工作原理。</p>
<p>It will press on the brakes and uh will limit the degree of weight loss.</p>
<p>限制减重幅度。</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>对吧？</p>
<p>It depends from person to person when those breaks are applied.</p>
<p>“刹车”时机因人而异。</p>
<p>Um but the key thing to note at this point of time is seeing whether there is weight regain or not.</p>
<p>关键是观察是否体重反弹。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-118"></a></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UXNezkEJF/?t=2489" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:41:29</span></a></h3>
<p>So Michelle you know all of us have been in that position where we have tried to lose weight and losing is not the difficult part but keeping it off is difficult because it's kind of like stretching a rubber band right when you stretch it the more you stretch the more it wants to snap back.</p>
<p>减重容易维持难，像拉橡皮筋，松手就回弹。</p>
<p>Um and what many of these medications do is that when the plateau does occur uh which is again part of just normal physiology uh these medications will prevent the cravings in our body in our brain to go up and it'll prevent the weight regain.</p>
<p>药物可抑制食欲，防止反弹。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p>So lack of additional weight loss doesn't mean failure of medications.</p>
<p>不再减重不代表药物失效。</p>
<p>Uh failure would be if there is weight regain.</p>
<p>反弹才是失败。</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>明白了。</p>
<p>So watch for that then um as kind of a next step for you Elaine.</p>
<p>Elaine，下一步请关注是否反弹。</p>
<p>Great question.</p>

<p>Yeah, what's your question?</p>
<p>请提问。</p>
<p>So, I've heard more and more uh recently that um feelings of hunger may may be impacted by um the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>最近听说饥饿感可能与肠道菌群有关。</p>
<p>And I was just wondering does um ompix and drugs like it somehow interact with or take advantage of the gut microbiome or if they don't um will there be drugs soon uh that do?</p>
<p>Ompic等药物是否利用菌群机制？未来会有此类药物吗？</p>

<p>Jane医生，请回答。</p>
<p>um you know our understanding of obesity is evolving on a day-by-day basis.</p>
<p>对肥胖的认识日益更新。</p>
<p>We understand that obesity is a multiffactorial disease.</p>
<p>肥胖是多因素疾病。</p>
<p>Uh so for some people it can be food noise or um you know the constant hunger.</p>

<p>Others it can be a change in metabolism that's leading to weight gain.</p>
<p>有人因代谢变化增重。</p>
<p>And then for some people as Kale mentioned it could be a change in the um microbiota of the gut or the flora and the fauna the microorganisms that feed in our gut.</p>

<p>Um there are a lot of research trials going on in this field and there is a chance that in the near future we will be having something uh that will address this but as of now none of the medications are addressing this.</p>

<p>Kale great question.</p>

<p>Uh H writes a simple question.</p>
<p>H提问：</p>
<p>Do you have to be on it forever?</p>
<p>需要终身用药吗？</p>
<p>It's a great question.</p>
<p>好问题。</p>
<p>So your body doesn't get addicted to this medication or this class of medications I should say at any point of time if there is any side effects or if you choose to not continue on this medication uh you can safely stop it.</p>
<p>不会成瘾，可随时安全停药。</p>

<p>The challenge is that the rubber band example that I gave you right um this medication's helping you stretch that rubber band or help you cut out that food chatter, the food noise and helping your body lose weight and maintain the weight that's lost.</p>
<p>但如橡皮筋比喻，药物帮助抑制食欲并维持体重。</p>
<p>uh when you stop pulling on the rubber band, it's going to snap back and hence we do see that uh not everyone but a majority of individuals may have some degree of weight regain.</p>
<p>停药后可能反弹。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UXNezkEJF/?t=2712" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:45:12</span></a></h3>
<p>It may not be all the weight that they have lost.</p>
<p>未必完全反弹。</p>
<p>It could be some um but they may have that because the cravings can then go back up.</p>
<p>但因食欲恢复，可能部分反弹。</p>
<p>Um but apart from that weight regain uh there are no other major issues that we see when an individual discontinues this medication and what about whether you're on it you know for a for the long term anyway perhaps not not as long as as for life but what would be uh the long-term risks do we know at this point or what what do we not know?</p>
<p>长期用药的风险如何？</p>

<p>So actually there was a very big study that was just completed last year uh one of the longest studies with this group of medications that looked at simaglletide uh vigovi uh for over five years in individuals who had previous heart attacks or stroke.</p>
<p>去年一项针对曾患心脏病或中风患者的大型五年研究显示。</p>
<p>So very high-risisk population right those who are quite sick and they use this medication in these individuals who had obesity along with cardiovascular disease for over 5 years and they saw that by using this medication you're able to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 20%.</p>
<p>用药可降低心脏病和中风风险20%。</p>

<p>So we're now entering this new era where we are finding that these medications apart from diabetes and weight loss they're now having some additional benefits probably by being able to reduce uh the inflammation uh in our body.</p>
<p>这类药物除控糖减肥外，还能减少炎症。</p>
<p>So it helps reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 20%.</p>

<p>It reduces the risk of heart failure which is basically when the pumping of the heart it's compromised.</p>
<p>降低心衰风险30-40%。</p>
<p>uh this medication helps reduce the risk of heart failure or hospitalization for heart failure and death occurring from heart failure by almost 30 to 40%.</p>
<p>减少心衰住院及死亡风险。</p>
<p>And interestingly, this is again, you know, where we uncovering a lot of data about this.</p>

<p>Uh we're now seeing that some studies that take into account people with alcohol use disorder, those people that have increased dependence on alcohol, the alcohol intake can go down by 50%.</p>
<p>对酒精依赖者，摄入量可减少50%。</p>
<p>um the risk of overdose uh can go down as well, drug overdose.</p>
<p>药物过量风险也降低。</p>
<p>Um we're now seeing that the fibrosis of the liver, which is basically when fat accumulates in the liver and undergo scarring, that can go down with this class of medications as well.</p>
<p>肝脏纤维化风险降低。</p>

<p>So it's it's kind of like the gift that keeps giving because we are figuring out a lot of other um applications.</p>
<p>这类药物益处不断被发现。</p>
<p>But of course, all of these are in various stages of uh research.</p>
<p>但多数研究仍在进行中。</p>
<p>Some of them are already approved for the management.</p>

<p>But as far as all of these research studies that have been done, the side effects whether it's short-term or long-term research are similar.</p>
<p>短期和长期副作用相似。</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal side effects are generally the most common.</p>
<p>胃肠道反应最常见。</p>

<p>I just wondering.</p>

<p>So this is not medical advice uh ot because obviously I don't know your medical history but uh technically ompic is a medication where the scientific name of that medication is called simaglutide.</p>

<p>the exact same molecule simaglletide um with a different brand name called vigovi is the one that's approved for the management of obesity um so because the medication is exactly the same but it's diff two different indications the name of the medication is uh different and uh it has been used off label um I mean ompic can be used off label for weight management if vigi is not covered by private extended benefits for instance because it's slightly cheaper at at the lower dose but um again I can't really sure you know comment on any of the specifics yeah no I I appreciate that and OT thank you very much uh for your question uh I I have two minutes left here Dr. Jane, but a couple of people have emailed in about affordability um uh because it's it's uh in BC covered under Pharmarmacare for uh diabetes but not for treatment of obesity.</p>
<p>完全相同的分子司美格鲁肽，呃，以另一个品牌名Wegovy被批准用于治疗肥胖，呃，因为药物完全相同但适应症不同，药物名称也不同，呃，它也被超说明书使用，呃，我的意思是如果Wegovy不在私人扩展保险范围内，Ozempic可以超说明书用于体重管理，因为低剂量时它稍微便宜一些，但呃，我确实无法具体评论，是的，不，我很感激，呃，OT非常感谢你的问题，呃，Jane医生，我还有两分钟，但有几个人发邮件询问 affordability，呃，因为在BC省它被药物保险覆盖用于糖尿病治疗，但不包括肥胖治疗。</p>

<p>There are calls for that to be expanded.</p>
<p>有人呼吁扩大覆盖范围。</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts about the affordability factor?</p>
<p>但你对 affordability 因素有什么看法？</p>
<p>I completely understand.</p>
<p>我完全理解。</p>
<p>We call obesity the mother of all chronic diseases.</p>
<p>我们称肥胖为所有慢性病之母。</p>
<p>We know that obesity is essentially what leads to down the line people developing diabetes, cholesterol problems, blood pressure problems, a host of other issues.</p>
<p>我们知道肥胖本质上会导致人们最终患上糖尿病、胆固醇问题、血压问题等一系列其他问题。</p>

<p>And unfortunately, we do treat or we have pharmarmacare coverage for diabetes, cholesterol, blood pressure and all those other things.</p>
<p>不幸的是，我们确实治疗或有药物保险覆盖糖尿病、胆固醇、血压和其他所有这些问题。</p>
<p>But if we were able to build the dam upstream, right, and address obesity definitively, nip it in the bud, then we could potentially prevent uh requiring medications or getting all these complications from these downstream effects.</p>
<p>但如果我们能在上游筑坝，对吧，彻底解决肥胖问题，防患于未然，那么我们就有可能避免需要药物或出现这些下游效应带来的并发症。</p>

<p>So I wholeheartedly agree with you.</p>
<p>所以我完全同意你的观点。</p>
<p>I think it's very important that we get those individuals who are suffering from obesity appropriate coverage.</p>
<p>我认为让那些患有肥胖症的人获得适当的保险覆盖非常重要。</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not covered anywhere in Canada under provincial form blurry.</p>
<p>不幸的是，在加拿大各省的保险中都没有覆盖。</p>
<p>But that's where again I think we need to raise our voices collectively and u talk to our lawmakers about this.</p>
<p>但这就是我认为我们需要集体发声并与立法者讨论的地方。</p>

<p>And just to be clear, I have 20 seconds here.</p>
<p>为了明确起见，我还有20秒。</p>
<p>Just to be clear, your your thoughts here about health concerns and not, you know, any kind of unhealthy body standards.</p>
<p>明确一下，你在这里的想法是关于健康问题，而不是任何不健康的身体标准。</p>
<p>That is correct.</p>
<p>这是正确的。</p>
<p>These are for people that have medical disease, obesity, uh not for someone uh that uh you know may want to lose a couple pounds uh for aesthetic reasons.</p>
<p>这些是针对患有医学疾病肥胖症的人，呃，而不是为了美观想减几磅的人。</p>
