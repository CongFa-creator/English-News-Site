<p>Let's get more now on our main news and the crash of that AirIndia plane banned for London seconds after it took off from the Indian city of Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>现在让我们详细了解头条新闻：印度航空一架飞往伦敦的航班在艾哈迈达巴德起飞后数秒坠毁。</p>
<p>Air India has now confirmed that of the 242 people on board, there's been only a single survivor.</p>

<p>It's not yet known how many people were killed on the ground as the aircraft came down on a medical college hostel.</p>
<p>飞机坠毁于一所医学院宿舍，地面伤亡人数尚不明确。</p>
<p>Well, the crash of the Air India jet has led to huge devastation in a residential area of Ahmedabad.</p>

<p>It it is early and the investigation is obviously just starting into this terrible crash.</p>

<p>But what can we um deduce from what we know as to the potential causes of this horrible accident?</p>
<p>根据现有信息，我们能推断出哪些可能导致这场悲剧的原因？</p>
<p>While it's too early to talk about causes, there were certain issues that were quite apparent.</p>

<p>One thing was the landing gear remained extended and that creates excess drag which can low lead to a lower climb rate and stall rest making altitude recovery a bit difficult.</p>
<p>其一起落架未收起导致过大阻力，可能降低爬升率并引发失速，使高度恢复困难。</p>
<p>Also one of uh the pilots who was on ground noticed the flap configurations were at 0° where they should have been between 5 to 10°.</p>
<p>此外，地面一名飞行员注意到襟翼角度为0°，而正常应在5°至10°之间。</p>

<p>Now at 37° centigrade temperature in Ahmedabad and uh a full fuel load this would result in the aircraft unable to climb and we had bird sorry we could have mult bird strikes that could have caused engine failure but it's all left to be seen and is it likely that the uh blackbox recorders will be found even though we saw that huge fireball.</p>
<p>艾哈迈达巴德37℃高温加上满载燃油可能导致飞机无法爬升，此外还可能遭遇鸟击引发引擎故障，但尚待证实。尽管火势猛烈，黑匣子仍有望找到吗？</p>
<p>Uh God willing they will be found given that uh they are made for very kind of uh strict they are really welld designed.</p>

<p>So they generally do enco encompass fire etc.</p>
<p>通常能抵御火灾等破坏。</p>
<p>But we'll have to see till they are found.</p>
<p>但需待寻获后才能确认。</p>
<p>It seemed pretty charred what we saw on television.</p>
<p>电视画面显示残骸烧焦严重。</p>
<p>and and what is known about the uh safety record of Air India because it was taken over obviously in the last few years by the Tatar group.</p>

<p>Yeah. uh since the Tata group has taken over this has been the first uh accident and uh the first unfortunately of the 787 globally and in 2020 Air India had an accident where about 23 people had died and uh so it's basically in a decade we've seen two accidents and and what about the record of this particular type of Boeing Uh this uh this Boeing 787 has a pretty good uh record.</p>
<p>塔塔接手后这是首起事故，也是全球787机型首次空难。2020年印度航空事故致23人遇难，即十年内共两起。这款波音787整体安全记录良好。</p>
<p>Um it's the first accident to happen in air and once it had happened on land uh which brought about the issue of the lithium batteries which were causing the fires which they have tried to fix.</p>

<p>Um was there any sort of market reaction to what's happened today?</p>
<p>今日事件引发市场反应了吗？</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean we saw initially when news started to emerge in pre-market trading there was a sharp drop in the share price of both uh Boeing and General Electric which makes the engines used in the 787 Dreamliner.</p>
<p>盘前交易中波音和GE（787引擎制造商）股价骤跌。</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DWMKzzEGe/?t=496" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:08:16</span></a></h3>
<p>Um since then they've sort of recovered slightly.</p>
<p>随后略有回升。</p>
<p>General Electric shares down around 2% and Boeing shares around 5%.</p>
<p>GE股价跌约2%，波音跌5%。</p>
<p>I mean, I think part of the concern is this is sort of a natural reaction you would expect to see to to a tragic event like this um from Wall Street, but also I think it's puts the spotlight back on the company for safety issues because of course it has been recovering um from from several incidents over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>华尔街对此类事件的常规反应，但这也使波音安全问题再次受关注——其正从近年多起事故中恢复。</p>

<p>Uh and the airline was seen to have made quite a lot of progress.</p>
<p>该公司已取得显著进展。</p>
<p>Uh but obviously now this will be a setback.</p>
<p>显然这会是个挫折。</p>
<p>Yeah. And obviously this is this is a different model to to the to the previous ones involved in um previous crashes.</p>
<p>此次涉事机型与以往空难不同。</p>
<p>But how much will US investigators now get involved?</p>
<p>美方调查将多深入？</p>

<p>Because we've heard that US and UK uh teams will go to India and will get involved.</p>
<p>美英团队将赴印参与。</p>
<p>It will be a global investigation to a degree led by India.</p>
<p>这将是以印度为主导的国际调查。</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, I mean so there is a protocol here and the investigation will be led by Indian authorities by the government of India but the NTSB here in America uh is sending a team of investigators over.</p>
<p>按规程由印度政府主导，但美国NTSB将派遣团队。</p>

<p>Now that team could include uh even people from Boeing itself.</p>
<p>团队可能包含波音人员。</p>
<p>Boeing has said they were ready to lend whatever assistance was needed.</p>
<p>波音表示愿提供一切协助。</p>
<p>um you know, they're going to need people who can who have experience not just of of crash scenes, complicated crash scenes, but also uh you know, for studying when they eventually recover uh the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, they're going to want, you know, people who can understand what information that reveals.</p>
<p>需既有空难现场经验又能分析黑匣子数据的专家。</p>

<p>They're going to need people who understand the 787 in great detail to try and figure out.</p>
<p>还需精通787机型的人员协助研判。</p>
<p>I mean, there are a lot of questions.</p>
<p>目前存在诸多疑问。</p>
<p>speaking to people today they say look this could be an issue related to poor maintenance it could be a mechanical issue it could be human error uh there are a lot of variables uh and I think it's going to be certainly weeks before we get any answers and for so for now there are simply sort of more questions and I think that's why you're going to have so many people involved in this investigation um but but they will take time to kind of find out exactly what happened here.</p>
<p>可能涉及维护不足、机械故障或人为失误，需数周才有答案，故需多方参与调查。</p>
