<h1>Iran's nuclear sites 'severely damaged' after operation of 125 warplanes - top US general | BBC News</h1>
<p>【伊朗核设施在125架战机行动后“严重受损”——美国高级将领 | BBC新闻】</p>
<p>Summary:
The U.S. Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff held a press conference regarding "Operation Midnight Hammer", describing it as precise, powerful, and clean, delivering a heavy blow to Iran’s nuclear program — although independent verification is still pending. The operation had been planned for months and marked the first use of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a bunker-busting bomb. It was conducted in close coordination with Israel. According to the U.S. military, the strike was executed with high skill and severely damaged Iran’s weapons and infrastructure. In total, 125 aircraft were deployed, along with 75 precision-guided missiles and 14 bunker-busting bombs, without any retaliation from Iran during the mission.</p>
<p>摘要：
美国防长与参谋长联席会议主席就“午夜铁锤行动”举行新闻发布会，称此次行动精准、强力且干净，重创伊朗核计划，但尚无独立验证。行动经数月策划，首次动用巨型钻地弹“掩体粉碎者”，并与以色列盟友密切协调。美军方称行动以高超技巧执行，严重破坏伊朗武器与基础设施，共出动125架战机、75枚精确制导弹及14枚钻地弹，全程未遭伊朗反击。</p>

<li><a href="#block-1">00:00:01 So, we've just been watching their press conference by the U</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-2">00:00:23 We heard Secretary Hegsth describe the operation as focused,</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-3">00:00:42 He said it had taken months and weeks of planning, positioni</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-4">00:01:04 We then heard from the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-5">00:01:30 He then described aircraft that had flown ahead of these big</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-6">00:01:53 um and that they had used 125 aircraft, 75 precision guided </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-7">00:02:16 But for now, let's go back over to Washington DC to our chie</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-8">00:02:30 They're clearly very happy with how this operation went.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-9">00:02:53 Um, and that is something that is, you know, is what you wou</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-10">00:03:10 um they repeated that kind of rhetoric.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-11">00:03:33 uh that may come in the coming days, it may not.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-12">00:04:02 uh and and so the messaging has begun on this uh and that wi</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-13">00:04:37 Quite the opposite of what the president said he was going t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-14">00:04:55 It's I think if you're going to get involved, then the way y</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-15">00:05:23 So if you're if you're going to do it uh you probably want t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-16">00:05:54 Yeah, I'll be honest with you.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:06:06 There was a lot going on.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:06:25 They have this gang of eight group of congressional leaders </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:06:46 But uh Donald Trump's not interested in that.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-20">00:07:02 Uh this is a you know they're hoping a oneanddone situation </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-21">00:07:18 All right Gary Odanhoo there in Washington.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:07:35 Mikey, there was a lot of terminology there, a lot of descri</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:07:50 Um well I think all the posturing that we saw last week um t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:08:36 So we saw that mass exodus the tankers the fighter jets the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:08:56 Yeah. The uh Pete Hexf used the word uh misinformation.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-26">00:09:15 Um, you'll have the core of that being the B2s with the GBU5</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-27">00:09:35 as are then coming over into into Europe and into the into t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-28">00:09:53 Um so what the fighter packages will be looking for is the s</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-29">00:10:30 So that's the general idea of it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:10:44 Um they've got an accuracy up to about 10 mters GPS guided w</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:11:00 They're used to what's called soften up targets if you like </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:11:18 And that was the whole intent of the package.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:11:36 Does that strike you as unusual that all of this would be ha</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:12:00 Um so you're minimizing any itrative effect to air operation</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:12:19 where you did see that bomb damage assessment video um balli</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:12:43 Um, you can't say you've destroyed something unless you've g</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:12:58 Uh, and it's a it's effectively a big tube strapped under an</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:13:19 Basically, they will film the bomb or the missile going in a</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:13:34 Uh I don't know what the what the um range is of a GBU57, bu</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-40">00:13:48 And then we're talking about facilities underground.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-41">00:14:02 So what was actually there in the first place?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:14:17 Now, as we've been hearing there, three key sites were hit.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:14:31 President Trump said the sites had been obliterated.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:14:55 But the main site hit was Fordo.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:15:18 Now, reaching this underground installation which is about 6</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:15:37 The official name is the GBU57, Massive Ordinance Penetrator</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:16:06 Well, let's have a listen to some of what the Iranian foreig</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:16:31 It is an outrageous, grave, and unprecedented violation of t</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:17:01 The US military attack on the territorial integrity and nati</a></li>
