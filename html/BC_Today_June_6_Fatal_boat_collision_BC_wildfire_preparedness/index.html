<li><a href="#block-132">00:51:33 And this is really just a time series as we go through.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-133">00:51:49 And we've also seen that elevated snow melt over the past we</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-134">00:52:08 And this data snapshots back from last week.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-135">00:52:32 Obviously at the higher elevations that snow is going to con</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-136">00:52:49 Now with the lower snow pack, we are seeing that diminished </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-137">00:53:06 And that's really going to be the key driver for ongoing flo</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-139">00:53:44 Uh in terms of the drought side of things now we are seeing </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-140">00:54:08 We've seen both short-term uh and long-term precipitation de</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-141">00:54:24 Uh we can also see that year on year in particular areas in </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-142">00:54:55 We can also look just from a climatological point of view.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-143">00:55:13 Um and particularly that rainfall piece, but the temperature</a></li>

<p>You're absolutely right.</p>
<p>您说得对。</p>
<p>It is a very tricky area because um you have the Kinder Morgan facility on the Southshore here and lots of the Boers like to give that space because there's oil tankers moving around there and so they tend to move to the north side of the channel which means they're right near where the boat launch is and so it does get to be a bit congested as you say with all kinds of different traffic from standup paddle boarders and kayakers up to oil tankers.</p>
<p>该区域情况复杂——南岸有金德摩根设施，油轮往来频繁，船只多转向北侧航道，导致船坡道附近交通混杂，从桨板到油轮各类船只交织。</p>

<p>Let's h take a call from David on the Sunshine Coast.</p>
<p>让我们接听阳光海岸大卫的电话。</p>
<p>Hi David, what are your thoughts on enforcement and education around boating safety?</p>
<p>嗨，大卫，你对划船安全方面的执法和教育有什么看法？</p>
<p>Well, it's it's a difficult area because a lot of people boat part-time.</p>
<p>嗯，这是一个困难的领域，因为许多人兼职划船。</p>
<p>You know, the boat gets put away for the off season and as soon as the nice weather comes, they're back on it, right?</p>
<p>你知道，船在淡季被收起来，一旦天气变好，他们又回来了，对吧？</p>

<p>So, you know, there's a lot of issues there.</p>
<p>所以，你知道，那里有很多问题。</p>
<p>Is their boat, you know, in tip-top condition, one thing and another.</p>
<p>他们的船是否处于最佳状态，等等。</p>
<p>M and you know currently all anyone needs to operate a boat is their PCOC which is a pleasurecraft operator certificate which is something anyone can get online.</p>
<p>嗯，你知道，目前任何人操作船只只需要他们的PCOC，即休闲船操作证书，这是任何人都可以在线获得的。</p>

<p>Um so you don't think that's enough?</p>
<p>嗯，所以你认为这不够？</p>
<p>No, it's not because you know you're operating you know you can operate about I believe it's up to 15 tons um with that license and you know they're operating about you know whatever the length is they could have you know twin 300 horsepower engines on it so you know it's capable of high speed and you know when you get up to like 20 knots what you tend to forget is you're going the length of a false field every few seconds.</p>
<p>不，不够，因为你知道你可以操作大约15吨的船只，他们可以操作任何长度的船只，可能配备双300马力的发动机，所以你知道它可以高速行驶，当你达到20节时，你往往会忘记你每几秒钟就行驶一个足球场的长度。</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>And quite often that's not possible.</p>
<p>而这通常是不可能的。</p>
<p>Um, years ago when I boated in Ontario to operate a vessel in Toronto Harbor, which I think would be a good idea for the, you know, for the greater Vancouver area, you had to have a license and that required a written exam and a practical test and um, you know, you just see too many close calls on the water.</p>
<p>嗯，几年前我在安大略省划船时，要在多伦多港操作船只，我认为这对大温哥华地区来说是个好主意，你必须拥有执照，这需要笔试和实际测试，嗯，你知道，你在水上看到太多千钧一发的情况。</p>

<p>Some of our members have responded to more calls than that.</p>

<p>And you know, a lot of them have been the result of complacency, um, not paying attention, um, not keeping their boat properly serviced.</p>
<p>你知道，其中很多是由于自满、不注意、没有妥善维护船只。</p>
<p>Um, another thing we do here, um, is we have a a a children's program and we start with children on the dock, the importance of wearing PFD.</p>

<p>The other thing we've done is a lot of times if we pull up in a marine search and rescue vessel and say, you know, excuse me folks, you really shouldn't be drinking and operating a boat, it's like we don't have the power to enforce, which is unfortunate.</p>
<p>我们经常驾驶救援船劝阻酒后驾船行为，但遗憾的是没有执法权。</p>
<p>But one of the things we do is with the youth program, we encourage children to observe the fact that you should not be operating a boat um under the influence.</p>

<p>So, you create that stigma that Ian was talking about.</p>

<p>The um and and what's interesting is if I tell an adult they shouldn't be drinking and operating their boat, you know, I probably I'm not going to get a Christmas card from them.</p>
<p>有趣的是，若我告诫成人不要酒后驾船，很可能被记恨。</p>

<p>What do you think of that idea? Well, yeah. No, it's possible.</p>

<p>A lot of the a lot of the restricted areas where there is restricted navigation, they have actual charted lanes where you can only operate in certain directions, you can only operate in certain speeds.</p>

<p>But that circles back to you have to have the navigation equipment to know where you are to know what lane you're in so you can observe the rules of the of the water.</p>

<p>We've reached the peak of the snow accumulation around about the middle of April, April 14th, and have been subsequently melting that snow off as we go through.</p>
<p>积雪峰值出现在4月14日左右，之后持续消融。</p>
<p>As of June 1st, we're seeing the continued trend of below normal snowpack with a provincial average of 44% of normal.</p>
<p>截至6月1日，积雪量持续低于正常水平，全省平均仅为正常值的44%。</p>

<p>What this really highlights when we look to the June survey is it gives us an idea of how the snow is melting rather than how much water was stored to start the year off with.</p>
<p>六月调查更突出积雪消融速度而非年初储水量。</p>
<p>We've seen this year kind of mixed conditions in terms of we've gone through the season with periods of slower snow melt and then periods of more rapid snow melt, particularly over the last week or so with the hot weather that we've seen.</p>

<p>So, as we come into the June 1st period, we're continuing to really see that below normal.</p>
<p>进入六月后，积雪量持续低于正常水平。</p>
<p>We're a couple weeks ahead in terms of that snow pack.</p>
<p>积雪消融比往年提前约两周。</p>
<p>We can look at this in terms of the automated weather station.</p>
<p>可通过自动化气象站数据观察。</p>

<p>And this is really just a time series as we go through.</p>
<p>形成时间序列数据。</p>
<p>And when we get outside of the colored bands, outside of the greens in this graph, it's really when we start to see extreme conditions.</p>
<p>当数据超出图表绿色区域时，意味着出现极端状况。</p>
<p>So, we can see this here has been tracking low in terms of that accumulation and that peak snowpack.</p>

<p>And we've also seen that elevated snow melt over the past week or so here.</p>
<p>过去一周左右消融速度加快。</p>
<p>So again, we're probably a couple weeks early in terms of that melt.</p>
<p>消融进程可能提前两周。</p>
<p>And we're seeing advanced snow melt.</p>
<p>积雪消融进展迅速。</p>
<p>About 2/3 of the snow that we started with this year have now melted.</p>
<p>年初积雪的三分之二已消融。</p>
<p>On a normal year, we would have only melted about half of that.</p>

<p>And this data snapshots back from last week.</p>
<p>此数据截取自上周。</p>
<p>And even if we look over the weekend, we've obviously seen much more accelerated melt with that snow that is remaining.</p>
<p>即便观察周末，剩余积雪消融明显加速。</p>
<p>We're really getting into the advanced stages of the snow melt freshet at this point.</p>
<p>目前正处于积雪消融洪峰的高级阶段。</p>
<p>With the monitored sites around the province that we really only have about a week or so left of snow.</p>

<p>Obviously at the higher elevations that snow is going to continue to linger as we go through the month here.</p>
<p>当然高海拔地区积雪将持续至月底。</p>
<p>So at this time of year we're often what we'll call the freshet.</p>
<p>此时节常称为"春汛期"。</p>
<p>We're often looking at the hazards related to that snow pack.</p>
<p>我们关注积雪相关风险。</p>
<p>The first one we're really focused on at this point in time is the flood hazard.</p>

<p>Now with the lower snow pack, we are seeing that diminished flood risk this year.</p>
<p>因积雪量少，今年洪水风险降低。</p>
<p>And now that that snow is depleted, we're really moving out of the peak phase of flood risk for the spring.</p>
<p>随着积雪耗尽，春季洪水高峰期已过。</p>
<p>As we go forward, really the key aspects are going to be whether or not we see any extreme rainfall type patterns.</p>
<p>未来关键在是否出现极端降雨模式。</p>

<p>And that's really going to be the key driver for ongoing flood risk or hazard as we go through the next few weeks.</p>
<p>这将是未来几周持续洪水风险的主因。</p>
<p>Here as discussed before June is the wet season particularly for the interior in the time where we can get upper low systems uh that can deliver uh both uh normal amounts of rain that are are beneficial but we can also see extreme rainfall events happen during this period.</p>
<p>正如之前讨论的那样，六月是内陆地区的雨季，在此期间我们可能会遇到高空低压系统，它们既能带来有益的正常降雨量，也可能引发极端降雨事件。</p>

<p>Um and particularly that rainfall piece, but the temperature can be important as well.</p>
<p>特别是降雨部分，但温度也很重要。</p>
<p>Uh driving up um increased evaporation and and really driving uh drought levels up.</p>
<p>推动蒸发量增加，并真正推高干旱等级。</p>
<p>So the province is assessing drought on a a weekly basis this this point in terms of drought levels.</p>

<p>Uh we're currently seeing those elevated levels particularly in the northeast with uh level three and four drought through the Fort Nelson, Norpiece uh and east piece regions, but we're also starting to see emerging drought levels ones and twos across the province.</p>
<p>目前我们看到干旱等级升高，特别是在东北部的纳尔逊堡、诺皮斯和东皮斯地区，达到了三级和四级干旱，但全省范围内也开始出现一级和二级干旱。</p>
<p>Uh again, those areas that we started the season with less snow, areas where the snow pack is now gone, uh and areas where snow maybe plays less of a role, particularly areas in the coast, Vancouver Island and uh and the Southwest.</p>
<p>再次强调，这些地区包括季节初积雪较少的地区、积雪现已消失的地区，以及积雪作用较小的地区，特别是沿海地区、温哥华岛和西南部。</p>

<p>Uh the weather spell we're going through right now is certainly adding to the evaporation and we do expect to see particularly in the short term uh that you're listening to Dave Campbell from the BC River Forecast Center.</p>
<p>我们目前经历的这段天气无疑加剧了蒸发，我们确实预计短期内会看到——您现在收听的是不列颠哥伦比亚省河流预报中心的戴夫·坎贝尔的报道。</p>
<p>You've heard him talk about the the dry weather spell right now and so the province is closely monitoring key indicators of drought risk and that includes a snow pack that he was just talking about.</p>
<p>您已经听到他谈论当前的干旱天气，因此该省正在密切监测干旱风险的关键指标，包括他刚才提到的积雪量。</p>

<p>And the river forecast c center's latest snowpack survey released uh today shows that BC's overall snowpack is less than half of normal levels, just 44%.</p>
<p>河流预报中心今天发布的最新积雪调查显示，不列颠哥伦比亚省的整体积雪量不到正常水平的一半，仅为44%。</p>

<p>因此，如果将低积雪量、早期融雪以及我们正在关注的这些温暖天气预报结合起来，它们都指向今年夏季可能出现更严重的干旱。</p>
