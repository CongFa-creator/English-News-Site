<p>【以色列继续对伊朗发动袭击，包括关键核设施 | BBC新闻】</p>
<p>Summary:
Israel said it continued attacking Iran after launching a large-scale offensive on Friday. In retaliation, Iran fired missiles at Israel. According to Israel, its aim was to weaken Tehran’s air defenses and strike bases capable of launching ballistic missiles and drones toward Israel. Multiple Iranian missiles were seen and heard over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The attacks targeted not only major cities, but also caused severe damage to buildings in several towns, resulting in three deaths. Daylight footage revealed that Israel’s highly regarded air defense system was not impenetrable. Iranian civilians, meanwhile, expressed a lack of safety as their military air defense struggled to fend off Israeli airstrikes. Iranian officials claimed about 80 people were killed, most of them civilians including children. Two senior military commanders and three nuclear scientists were also reportedly assassinated.</p>
<p>摘要：
以色列称在周五开始大规模进攻后，继续对伊朗发动袭击。伊朗则向以色列发射导弹进行报复。以色列表示其目标是削弱德黑兰的防空能力及可向以色列发射弹道导弹和无人机的基地。伊朗发射的多枚导弹在耶路撒冷和特拉维夫上空可见可闻，袭击不仅针对主要城市，多个城镇的建筑也遭受严重破坏，造成三人死亡。天亮后的画面显示，以色列备受推崇的防空系统并非无懈可击。伊朗民众则缺乏安全感，其军事防空系统难以抵御以色列空袭。伊朗官员称约80人丧生，其中多为平民包括儿童，另有两名高级军事指挥官和三名核科学家遇刺。</p>

<p>And Joe, I know you've been busy monitoring what is happening on the ground.</p>
<p>乔，你一直在监测实地情况。</p>
<p>just in terms of the kind of firepower that Israel needs in order to reach those very deep facilities that Iran has.</p>
<p>以色列需何种火力打击伊朗深埋设施？</p>
<p>Does Israel have it?</p>
<p>是否具备？</p>
<p>The short answer is no, it doesn't.</p>
<p>简言之：否。</p>
<p>So, just to kind of talk you through a few the different sort of facilities there are.</p>
<p>简述各类设施：</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-14"></a></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1E1MSz5EeQ/?t=280" target="_blank"><img src="icon_bilibili.png" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:6px;" /><span>00:04:40</span></a></h3>
<p>So, there's some of them are relatively close to the surface, some are on the surface, but there's a couple of them that we know about or experts say they know about.</p>
<p>部分浅层或地表，专家称已知两处深层——</p>
<p>one called Foral and a new one that's being built at Mount Kolang.</p>
<p>福尔多与在建的科朗山设施。</p>
<p>And these are about 80 m to 100 meters below the surface and these are under reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>位于地下80至100米，钢筋混凝土加固。</p>

<p>And this is one of the reasons that so many people said that a military solution or a military um attack to take out the um Iranian nuclear program.</p>
<p>此乃军事解决伊朗核计划极难之因。</p>
<p>It is so difficult if not impossible for the Iranians.</p>
<p>几无可能。</p>
<p>So there are weapons that can, you know, penetrate significant amounts of concrete.</p>

<p>There's one that is called the GBU57B, the uh possibly more kind of colloially known as massive ordinance penetrator or a bunker buster.</p>
<p>如GBU-57B巨型钻地弹。</p>
<p>This is saying the Americans have got 30,000 lb bomb that is dropped from a B2 stealth bomber and that can get down about 60 m.</p>
<p>美制3万磅炸弹由B2轰炸机投掷，可钻60米。</p>
<p>Now, if a couple of those could hit the same spot over a number of days, they might be able to get down.</p>

<p>The Israelis don't have that.</p>
<p>以色列无此装备。</p>
<p>the most penetrating bomb they're thought to have had.</p>
<p>其最强穿透炸弹——</p>
<p>There are two they've got.</p>
<p>现有两种：</p>
<p>One's called the Rocks or the other one is the Air Laura and they can get down about 6 m or so.</p>
<p>"岩石"与"劳拉"，仅约6米。</p>
<p>Now, there has been some footage.</p>
<p>现有画面显示——</p>
<p>I think we can show this now, some a 3D graphic that was released by the Israeli military.</p>

<p>Now, this shows an attack on the Natan's facility.</p>
<p>对纳坦兹设施的袭击。</p>
<p>Now what you're going to see here uh is this is again this was released by the Israelis and this shows one of the uh facilities they've they say they have damaged or they say very badly damaged this shows an enrichment hall with some centrifuges and when the facility is this close to the surface maybe 10 meters below then it is conceivable that the more limited uh munitions that the Israelis have could get through but the more deep ones the ones they really need to take out if they are going to achieve this stated aim well well they can't do that without American munitions</p>
<p>浅层浓缩大厅（约10米深）或可被以军有限弹药破坏，但深层目标需美制武器。</p>

<p>And that's the point, isn't it?</p>
<p>关键在此。</p>
<p>Because America says that they knew about this, but they weren't involved in this.</p>
<p>美国称知晓但未参与。</p>
<p>And that's that's critical.</p>
<p>至关重要。</p>
<p>And yet yesterday, we had that line from Donald Trump say suggesting that Israel was using capabilities from the US.</p>
<p>然特朗普暗示以色列使用美方能力。</p>
<p>It's it's a little bit vague, a little bit difficult to follow.</p>
<p>表述模糊难解。</p>

<p>I think that's a very diplomatic way of putting the uh describing the messages we've been getting from the US.</p>
<p>此乃对美国矛盾信号的外交式描述。</p>
<p>I think often highly contradictory.</p>
<p>常自相矛盾。</p>
<p>You know, we had Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, came out almost immediately and said this was unilateral, that they weren't involved, although he did emphasize Israel had a right to defend itself as they always do.</p>
<p>国务卿卢比奥立即称系单边行动，但强调以色列自卫权。</p>

<p>And then we had Donald Trump coming out and saying, you know, in some ways praising it, saying he had known about it in advance.</p>
<p>特朗普则提前知情并赞扬。</p>
<p>I think most people think that Donald Trump would would have given this some sort of uh, you know, green light or amber light maybe.</p>
<p>多数认为特朗普或曾默许。</p>
<p>But there's a big there is a difference and a very crucial military difference especially when it comes to achieving these aims between the Americans saying go for it and the Americans directly being involved because as I say they are the ones that have got the capability to destroy these facilities if they wanted to get involved.</p>
<p>但"支持"与"直接参与"存在关键军事差异——唯美军有能力摧毁这些设施。</p>

<p>We heard previously from Hugo Bachega, uh, his report at the top of the program.</p>
<p>此前胡戈·巴切加在节目开头报道。</p>
<p>A short time ago, Hugo also joined us from Rishon Luzion, an area which was badly hit by Iran's missiles.</p>
<p>稍早胡戈从遭袭严重的里雄莱锡安连线：</p>
<p>Here's what he told us.</p>
<p>其描述如下：</p>
<p>So, this is the scene here in Rishon Litzion.</p>

<p>And let me get to let me give you an idea of of what's happening here because this is where the missile hit.</p>
<p>容我说明：此处为导弹击中点。</p>
<p>So, there's a lot of destruction here.</p>
<p>破坏严重。</p>
<p>All these houses have been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>房屋全毁。</p>
<p>And you know this gives you an idea of the power of the blast, the power of the attack that happened here.</p>
<p>可见爆炸威力。</p>

<p>And all morning residents have been coming here to collect some objects.</p>
<p>居民整晨前来抢救物品。</p>
<p>And you can see here there is uh you know a family trying to recover anything they can find can uh can find in this in this house that's been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>这家人正从废墟中搜寻财物。</p>
<p>Let me give you uh you know a sense of what's happening around here because there's a lot of destruction all around and take a look at these cars uh around me which are completely destroyed and also you know the houses here that have been damaged.</p>
<p>周边损毁严重——车辆全毁，房屋受损。</p>

<p>So again gives you an idea of of of the power of of this attack that happened here.</p>
<p>再显袭击威力。</p>
<p>It was a very long night of attacks with sirens sounding across the country.</p>
<p>全国警报长鸣的漫长之夜。</p>
<p>I was in Jerusalem and just before dawn uh there were loud explosions of air defense systems trying to intercept those missiles that were fired by uh Iran in in this response to those attacks that happened yesterday.</p>
<p>黎明前耶路撒冷防空系统拦截伊朗报复导弹的爆炸声。</p>

<p>The Israeli military saying that around 200 missiles were fired by the Iranian military.</p>
<p>以军称伊朗发射约200枚导弹。</p>
<p>So again a huge uh large scale attack by the Iranian military in response to those uh Israeli attacks that happened yesterday.</p>
<p>伊朗军方对昨日以军袭击的大规模报复。</p>
<p>Hugo Vega there from uh Rishon Lission which was as you can see there badly hit by one of Iran's missiles.</p>
