<li><a href="#block-16">00:06:54 We've seen how those have played out.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-17">00:07:20 So you would like to see an outside investigation or review </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-18">00:07:48 We need to make sure that those voices are put at the forefr</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-19">00:08:11 They reached out to you in the aftermath of this tragedy fro</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-21">00:09:10 It is impossible, impossible to place the blame on the healt</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-22">00:09:49 So there's a major shift in culture there that needs to happ</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-23">00:10:14 They know what's going on with their bodies, with their chil</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-24">00:10:34 We just got an email in that I wanted to read from Alfred an</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-25">00:10:57 But there are those about someone who has led to death, unno</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-29">00:12:33 And some of them get into even more minuscule potential, but</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-30">00:12:58 This isn't a nice, laid-in event.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-31">00:13:23 But as we move to a more centralized healthcare model, as it</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-32">00:13:48 The disparity now in British Columbia is massive.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-33">00:14:10 It's not the small regional hospitals, Komox Valley Hospital</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-34">00:14:45 And some of my friends have been turned away.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-35">00:15:13 I can't imagine a somebody that was lucky enough to be pregn</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-36">00:15:43 I just wanted to say too that when I was pregnant, I had a m</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-37">00:16:15 But then also knowing, you know, there's no actual OB, like </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-38">00:16:45 Whether there is an ambulance on hand.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-39">00:17:05 It's the cost of rural residents to access care when it's be</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-41">00:17:40 They're, it's averaging $3,000 now for a rural British Colum</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-42">00:18:00 Yes, I can.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-43">00:18:25 It doesn't happen again.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-44">00:18:46 And they can't do anything.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-45">00:19:06 The health professions review board said it was inadequate.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-46">00:19:26 Like three people died.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-47">00:19:46 There's so much going on.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-48">00:20:12 And there's still the stewards of all of this or the people </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-49">00:20:40 They all stand as education.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-50">00:20:58 We don't hear about them because the people speaking up on t</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-55">00:22:40 I live in Oliver so the loss of my ability to drive has been</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-56">00:23:03 And Andreas said my concern about dealing with chronic pain </a></li>

<li><a href="#block-63">00:26:05 I do not.</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-67">00:27:23 Yes.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-68">00:27:56 Well, after years of soaring prices and new builds, Metro Va</a></li>

<li><a href="#block-70">00:28:47 Count 690 on your cell phone.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-71">00:29:09 Thanks so much for coming in.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-72">00:29:32 Yeah, even with rate drops that we've been seeing, we've see</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-73">00:30:07 And Ben, what are you hearing in terms of questions or conce</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-74">00:30:29 How are people feeling?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-75">00:30:49 And for sellers, it's really about trying to understand what</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-76">00:31:17 And some people can't wait for the long term so they have to</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-77">00:31:42 So in the condo market, we're right now in the cost of the b</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-78">00:32:03 But I think what's really important to remember is what the </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-79">00:32:27 Right.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-80">00:32:52 It's about what is the right term that will fit with your va</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-81">00:33:14 60% of homeowners in Canada typically break their five year </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-82">00:33:48 Ben and McMullen, who is the CEO of the Urban Development In</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-83">00:34:09 At the end of the day, we have to build housing that's going</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-84">00:34:32 But I think that shift is now being peeled back a little bit</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-85">00:35:21 Yeah, we definitely have seen clients with concerns about co</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-86">00:35:44 Maybe we do need additional down payment, maybe a co-signer </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-87">00:36:05 If you have an experience either buying or selling a condo n</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-88">00:36:30 And they're here to answer your questions.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-89">00:36:55 But we also have people saying there's not enough housing fo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-90">00:37:17 And the expectation this year was that that was going to be </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-91">00:37:45 They're just not acting right now.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-92">00:38:09 Yeah, I mean, and it's hard to pinpoint specifically if that</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-93">00:38:33 Real estate is an Vancouver and interesting market because i</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-94">00:38:59 They would get outpins so they perhaps would not get an insp</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-95">00:39:28 And we see a lot of our borrowers, too, they're asking a lot</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-96">00:40:02 And how do you sort of, you know, I know things wax and wane</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-97">00:40:31 I think one thing that we really encourage our clients to th</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-98">00:40:56 They want fixed rates for predictability, for stability.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-99">00:41:22 Sure, not to be locked in something long term.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-100">00:41:42 Thanks for calling BC today.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-101">00:42:06 But basically, my question is I know that they increased the</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-102">00:42:29 Or if there's anything I can do to apply for some sort of re</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-103">00:42:44 Are you talking about the property transfer tax exemption or</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-104">00:43:10 Is that correct?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-105">00:43:38 All right, Patrick.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-106">00:44:04 Yes, rates have been steady for the last few months and quit</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-107">00:44:31 It really just depends on where the bond yields sit that day</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-108">00:45:00 Yeah, I mean, it depends on what your investment criteria ar</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-109">00:45:32 All right, so I'm seeing a lot of parents who are purchasing</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-110">00:46:02 So we have to have a longer term approach where we're thinki</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-111">00:46:27 And that was the first either of us had ever heard that appr</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-112">00:46:46 Hi, Micah. What's your question for today?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-113">00:47:07 Yeah, I mean, sort of just putting a tent up, you've got to </a></li>
<li><a href="#block-114">00:47:31 And so most of the time when we're looking at land financing</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-115">00:47:53 And if you do, what are the plans? Do you have the blueprint</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-116">00:48:12 OK. Does that answer your question, Micah?</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-117">00:48:34 I think I'm going to let you both weigh in on this, perhaps.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-118">00:49:03 And it's because, you know, with our banks, they have to loo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-119">00:49:29 But I would say that most of the time right now we do see mo</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-120">00:50:04 And especially, of course, in Vancouver.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-121">00:50:38 It's just that fear right now it's holding people back.</a></li>
<li><a href="#block-122">00:51:01 All right. And in terms of sort of feeling that fear, final </a></li>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:47:31,559', '00:47:41,439')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> And so most of the time when we're looking at land financing, you're typically looking at 65% loan to value, maybe sometimes up to 75% loan to value.</p>
<p>大多数情况下，土地融资的贷款价值比通常是65%，有时可能高达75%。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:47:41,440', '00:47:47,439')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> So what that means is you're looking at having to put about 25 to 35% down payment.</p>
<p>这意味着你需要支付约25%至35%的首付。</p>
<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:47:47,440', '00:47:53,799')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> On top of that, of course, again, banks want to know, you know, are you planning to construct on the property?</p>
<p>此外，银行还想知道你是否计划在土地上建造房屋。</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:48:01,880', '00:48:12,358')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> I would say that definitely chat with a mortgage broker or a mortgage specialist and they'll be able to kind of help guide you on what the requirements are to help you with the financing.</p>
<p>我建议你与抵押贷款经纪人或专家聊聊，他们可以指导你满足融资要求。</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:49:03,759', '00:49:14,198')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> And it's because, you know, with our banks, they have to look at their balance sheet and where rates are at that time in terms of Bank of Canada's prime interest rate.</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:49:29,599', '00:49:37,239')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> But I would say that most of the time right now we do see most clients will only go up to five years.</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:49:37,239', '00:49:46,440')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> And it is because I think in our day and age, a lot of clients do purchase up size and we are usually moving around as well.</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:49:46,440', '00:49:53,559')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> So after five years, mortgages tend to be broken and then people are moving or porting their long.</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:50:07,559', '00:50:16,198')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> I think that, you know, right now is sort of the window of opportunity, especially for some home buyers, we spoke really about the pace of the market.</p>

<p><button class="play-button" onclick="playAtTimestamp('00:50:23,360', '00:50:38,718')"><img src="play.png" alt="Play"></button> This is one of them.
